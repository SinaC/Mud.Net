Entrance to Cage and Aquarium~
You fall into a brightly lit yet very surreal looking field. The sun is
shining, the birds are singing, and you are suddenly overtaken by an
overwhelming feeling of love. Unfortunately, at the same time you're starting
to get a nagging feeling that something is also terribly amiss. Looking up, you
watch the opening that you entered through from above close up and disappear.
As you look around, you notice a small welcoming sign. Beyond the sign there
is a path leading down to a road.

Somewhere on Toddler Hiway~
You stand on a road named Toddler Hiway. The road looks as though it runs in a
straight line to the east and west. There is a small path on a hill leading up
and perhaps back out of this crazy place. To the south you see an old and
beaten up camping trailer. There is alot of screaming going on in there, so
maybe now is not such a good time to knock on the door.

painted underneath the window.~

A Hotel Room~
You stand in a lavishly decorated room. Too bad everything is nailed down! The
sunlight from the outside is dimmed and filtered by the window shades.

Everything is in place in this room, and it appears to have been cleaned
recently...except...what IS that on the floor?

A Hotel Room~
It appears the maid has not cleaned this room just yet. The bed is unmade and
the floor is littered with cosmetics.

A Hotel Room~
You've entered an impressive hotel suite, which appears to offer all the
amenities of a fine establishment. The window shade is closed which makes the
room somewhat dim. You squint to see the occupant.

A Silver Spaceship~
You enter a silver colored orb from another place and time. There are some
places to sit mounted on the floor, and glowing panels adorn the walls. Many
lights flicker and flash and you find them to be quite intriguing. The orb
appears to be damaged and stuck here, and you conclude that it does not truly
belong in this wonderous place.

Cabbagetown~
You land on a very small island that seems to be uninhabited. The roar of the
surf is quite load as it smashes against the rocks. You look just in time to
see your boat slammed against the sharp rocks. You sigh as it is torn to
pieces and the ocean steals the shattered bits away from you. It looks as
though you may be here for awhile.

You are standing in a filthy cage. This one is empty, and judging from the
