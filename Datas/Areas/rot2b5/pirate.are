Captain Amos Trask~
The Captain~
Captain Amos Trask is here yelling orders to his crew.
~
The captain is a man in his fifties.  What's left of his hair is slicked
and tied at the back of his head.  He has had much experience in
commanding rowdy pirate crews.  He has a tough, weather-worn face and
a stern complextion.  He must have been BAD to get into such a command
so don't mess with him!

Navigator~
The Navigator~
The ship's navigator is trying to figure out which sea route to take.
~
The navigator looks rather busy.  He has a pencil stuck on his ear.
He is a rather young scholar with some minor experience in navigation.
He looks like he has been missing some sleep because of working on all
those maps.  Yet, he still seems ready to react to anything quickly
and defend himself if necessary.  He tells you to leave his equipment
alone!

First Mate~
The First Mate~
The First Mate is taking a break from the Captain's sharp tongue.
~
The first mate looks rather stressed.  He has been doing things for
the captain all day and is now relieved to have his break.  He seems
to have an air of command around him which must explain why he got
his position on the ship as a First Mate.

Cook chef~
The Ship's Cook~
The ship's Cook is preparing Gak for the crew to eat.
~
The cook is rather sloppy.  His hands are as dirty as his clothing.  He
is running around the room preparing one thing after the next.  He
constantly keeps an eye on the big cauldron in the center of the room.
It looks like he mixes whatever leftovers he has into the cauldron and
calls it food.  For some strange reason, you loose your appetite.

blood sea~
The sea is so vast, it covers the expanse of the horizon from east to west.
The water in the sea is deep red in color thus begetting it its name.  The
color is supposedly caused by an enourmous underwater whirlpool which
stirs the ocean dirt up making the water reddish.
