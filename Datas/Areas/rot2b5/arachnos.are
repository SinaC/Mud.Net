A Link in the Ethereal Web~
This is another link in the ethereal web.  Various creatures
seem to get caught (or hypnotized) by its sticky strands.  A single
spider line lies to the north, while ghastly seemings are due
southward.  The grim entrance of Arachnos' Lair is downward.

Entrance to the Donjonkeep~
A dark path at the end of the web strand, you see ahead
a torch lit chamber where the souls of unavenged adventurers
come and gnash their teeth.  The howls and screams of many echo
through the hall ways.  You see one definite path ahead.

Realm of the Hopeless~
Here you see many misguided souls who think they still live.
They search for those who killed them without warrant, and seek the
free souls of living beings to inhabit and perhaps adventure once
more.

The Donjonkeep~
No souls have ever lived in this place.  The wails of slaves
and the howls of wolves are the only way you can describe the sounds
you hear.  The walls are thin and wispy.  The only light you receive
is the shimmering from the strand of the ethereal web you used to get
here.

The Single Spider Line~
A single spider line supports you once more.  As you look
across the ether you seen a single shack up ahead with a light in
the window.  You sense a great evil coming from the east and feel
inclined to go back on the ethereal web and take your chances there.

The Hermit's Corner~
Here you see evidence of a vagrant's abode.  The shack is to the
east, if you dare enter it.  You get the sneaking feeling you should
go back now.  The skies above you darken and roar with the laughter
of thunder.

Mahatma's Inescapable Trap~
Mahatma, that silly thief, is here, and he steals everything you
have.  He says, 'Here, have a quick trip to the Temple of Midgaard.'
He plunges a black dagger into your back ...

The Sticky Chamber~
You can still bail out since your knees are shaking from the
anticipation (or is it fear?).  The sky is clear on this strand of
web, surprisingly unsticky.  The strand does not vibrate like the
others.  A few ballooning spiders pass by, cackling "You're gonna
die, you're gonna fry.  Good bye!"

The Great Door~
Before you you see a large, web-like door.  Various designs
of ancient runes and names of Midgaard heroes are etched into
the webwork.  Perhaps lists of victims?  You can't tell.

The Lair of Arachnos~
This is the lair of the Empress Spider, Arachnos.  A lavishly
adorned rainbow web, her lair allows her to move to any universe
she wishes by using her magical strands to the Prime Material Plane.
Coffers upon coffers of gold, magical jewels and gems await.  Unfor-
tunately Arachnos is a baggy spider too, and webs all her treasures
to her beautiful silken body.
