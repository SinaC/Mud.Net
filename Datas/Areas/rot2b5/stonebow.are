the stucco walls, tied with twine or ribbon, pots of herbal extracts
and medicines line the wall behind the long marble counter in the
back corner.  A large skylight opening allows sunlight to stream across
the leafy, lush green plants.  Small stands and carts are arranged
throughout.  Large bouquets of fresh-cut flowers and garlands festoon
the marble counter, ready to be purchased for the last-minute wedding...
or a quick romantic evening.  A stone door is located to the west,

Photographer's studio~
Hmmm...this place looks more like a mad scientist's laboratory than a
photographer's studio...test tubes, bubbling potions, steaming flasks,
and coils of copper and glass tubing litter the main counter, as well as
those along each wall.  Long strips of sticky yellow film hang from the
rafters, twisting lazily.  Upon closer examination, you discover

This small, well-tended shop has a clean-pressed, immaculate look to it.
The north wall is lined with trim, narrow shelves sporting a wide array
of hats in all shapes, styles, and colors.  The south wall is similarly

hat racks lines each side of the aisle leading to the back of the shop

Scraggly weeds lie forlornly tangled at about knee-height.  Ivy clings
desperately to the cobbles of the surrounding buildings, and creeps
upward toward the eaves.  A huge tree with faded, papery silver bark
grows in the center of the courtyard, its branches spreading parallel
to the ground, and reaching up much farther than the eyes can see.
Small, dull gold-brown leaves seem to cling for dear life to the tree,
and appear to be long dead.  There is an exit north, and one to the east.

flasks, jars, canisters, and tubes of all shapes and sizes seem to be
cast about the shop haphazardly.  Despite the disarray, the place has
a cheery feel, the scent of orange peel and rose hips, cinnamon and
cloves, bergamot, jasmine, berries, and cedar and sandalwood intermingle
and seem to seep into your senses.  In the middle of the store is a
narrow granite counter, almost hidden by potions, petals, and powders.
In the center of it is a large mortar and pestle, and a burner upon
which some mysterious but arousing liquid bubbles and foams.

This wooden-plank lined room is....unimpressive at best.  Black and
pink checkered curtains hang limply from the windows.  A single,
tattered brown streamer is tiredly tacked to the front of the plywood
podium.  A gilded-frame picture of the Almighty Elvis hangs lopsidedly
next to an old photo labeled "Forrest Gump".  Near the ramshackle podium
is an old willow rocker, in which slumps perhaps the OLDEST creature
living...you know it's alive, as a thin trickle of smoke dribbles lazily
from a drooping corncob pipe between its withered lips.  A large
sunflower is displayed prominently in front of the podium.

The healing room~
This peaceful, quiet room is the epitome of tranquillity.  Pecan paneling
and flooring glisten throughout, its medium-colored wood polished to an
unearthly brightness.  A small fountain, spring-fed from the watersource
behind the church, bubbles quietly in the center of the room, and is
surrounded by four walkways, each leading from the four central
directions to its edge.  The cistern is cool black marble, and a light
from some unknown source glows from within its depths.  Bright,
brilliant goldfish and carp flash and flip about the pool surrounding
the central square.  Leafy, feathery plants grow throughout and surround
the fountain and the wall perimeter.  The south wall is paneled in a
darker-pecan carved screen, from behind which a soft yellow light glows
peacefully.  Zabuton pillows, thin yet comfortable, are scattered about
the floor.  The exit is to the north.

floor to the south.  A small footbridge divides the brook, and small fish
can be seen darting about beneath the water.  There is a carved wooden
altar near the north wall, small, comfortable benches face the altar in
two columns forming a single row from north to south.  There is a paneled

This massive room is lavishly paneled in dark, rich mahogany, polished
to an unearthly glow.  Rows and rows of matching dark pews are lined
up neatly on either side of a long central aisle.  A lavishly
embroidered runner in blues, golds, and reds runs between the rows of
pews.  Four ceiling-high, elaborately-colored stained glass windows
decorate the north wall behind the main altar, and depict the four
primary gods and goddess of Thera in various poses: Vengeance, Eriana,
Felix, and Tim, as they represent the four primary directions of the map.
Deep, rolling bass organ music plays softly from a hidden source, and
seems to roll from the top of the carved wooden cathedral ceiling.
Silver candelabras holding long white tapers glow softly at the back of
the room, along the aisle, and around the altar.  There is a door to the
north, near the altar, an exit east into the chapel, one south to the
vestibule, and one west into the sister-sanctuary.

Cool, matronly willows are scattered here, their branches high enough
to not annoy most guests.  A sanded path leads from the south exit to
the sanctuary to the gazebo at the north end.  On either side of the
path is a row of smooth, polished brown stones, interspersed with
groundflowers, violets, starflowers, dandelions, and chrysanthemums.
There is ample room on each side of the path for benches or chairs,
used frequently for large weddings and parties.  The large, glistening
white summerhouse is to the north, beneath it runs the east-west
running brook, from which an outlet has been formed to create a large
rock garden and waterfall to the southeast of the gazebo.  A tall hedge
grows behind it, running north-south, and obscuring a corner of the
gardens.  The exits here are north to the summerhouse, east to the

This immaculately painted white summerhouse is a popular locale for

paneling on the off-walls.  Leafy plants and dazzling flowers trail
lazily from hanging baskets anchored around the ceiling perimeter.
Padded, comfortable white benches are arranged in two rows on either
side of the central north-south aisle.  The garden brook runs beneath
the summerhouse in an east-west direction, one arm of it bends southward
and spills into a waterfall and rock garden immediately to the southeast.
The paneling north is butted up against a tight privet hedge, beyond
which nothing can be seen.  The only exit is south, into the central

willows obscures the sky here, and the temperature is much cooler here
than in any part of the garden.  This is an excellent place to meditate,
rest, or recuperate, it seems well-protected and hidden enough that no

Crystal Square~
Located at the intersection of Redfern Road and DragonCove, this square
is rather small in contrast to its northern counterpart.  Instead of a
fountain, here is situated an obsidian pedestal, upon which is balanced
a huge blue crystal.  It appears that nothing holds the crystal in place,
yet it balances perfectly on one pointed tip.  Redfern Road runs east and
west of here, DragonCove Road runs north and south.  There is a signpost
here.

blue crystal~
This crystal is a complete mystery, it stands about eight feet tall,
and is made of some completely clear crystal of unknown origin or
purpose.  Roughly marquis-shaped, it balances on one point, its other
pointed skyward.  Lights dance within the depths of the glass, bursting
into a myriad of colors deep within, and radiate outward, causing the
crystal to appear surrounded by some mystical aura It hums faintly.

Signpost~

Oceanside Road~
You stand on the edge of a cliff overlooking the southern ocean.
To the north, a dense forest forces you to walk a little too close
to the sheer drop-off to your south.  A city wall is just visible
to the west.  To the east, the forest thins out and the shoreline
below you improves.
