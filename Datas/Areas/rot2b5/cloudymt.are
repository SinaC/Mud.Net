This area is based on the Intellivison game "Advanced Dungeons and Dragons" 
which is of course based on TSR's role playing game.  The name Cloudy Mountain,
the caves in Cloudy Mountain and the mobs in Cloudy Mountain are taken 
directly from the game and credit should be given to Matel Electronics and TSR.
The city/village is from Scourge, summer 1996.  Some mob ideas are from TSR's
Monstrous Manual, copyright 1993, TSR, Inc.

Before the City of Cloudy Mountain~
In this are many dragons and half-dragons.  Under normal circumstyles,
dragons tend to live in solitary environments, but due to disappearing 
territories, many have gathered in this city.  Some have also have taken 
spouses from other races, creating new half-races.  Although legally these
half-dragons are to be treated equal, most of the high ranking officials and
officers are pure dragon.

at least the same, if not more.  To the north is the King's palace, and a road
follows the north wall east.  The court is south and west.

nobles were against the marriage.  It has been rumored that Drakknar committed
this ghastly act, but those who know him well do not believe this.

You have entered Scourge's private room.  It is rather dark, those of 
good alignment may find it sinister and feel uncomfortable...those who walk
the path of evil are right at home.  There is a roaring fire in the fireplace,
yet the room feels chilly.  There are some plants in the window, but they 
appear to be dead.  Scourge is sitting in a black and red chair, he grins 
at you evilly.
