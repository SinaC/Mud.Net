North east corner on Wrym and Sunrise~
You stand in the north east corner of the city.  There is an eerie calm here,
muffled echoes bounce off the cavern walls and into your ear.  You can
hear the screams of the slave, the talking of adventurers.  The cavern walls
loom up to the east and north of you.  You light doesn't even illuminate up
to the ceiling.  Darkness surrounds you.  The ground is hard and grey.  The
walls are grey, and glint with wetness.  You wish you could recall to
Midgaard, but alas, that is impossible.

You stand on Moonlight avenue, thinking the name is a cruel joke on
surface dwellers for you wish you could see the moon, not the continuous
darkness that lives in this city.  Everywhere darkness creeps, even with the
lights that adorn some of the streets, it is still dark. To your east lies the
entrance to a dark building and it see to just disappear into the night.  The
door seems to be rusted shut.

here are not as used as those towards the centre of the city.  To the south
you see some of the dwellings of the creatures that inhabit this gloomy
city.  There is nothing of note that you can see here, but then again it could
just be the darkness that lies just beyond your insignificant circle of light.

Sunset~
You wonder who it was that named these dreadful streets such cheery
names.  The street upon which you stand is nothing like sunset, the only
reason you can even think up is the fact that sunset if on the west side of
the city.  Screams echo towards you from all sides assaulting your senses. 
You eyes hurt from trying to pierce the darkness that lies everywhere.  The
ground is rough through your boots.  The air is cool, and the cavern wall to
your west glints with wetness.

dark blue rock.  The house, if that is what it is, seems to be very dark with
no windows.  The house stretches to the east and west.  The walls are very
smooth and glint in your light.  The entrance is to the north.

You stand on Ruby street, one of the streets of gems.  You heard a voice
while walking through the Underdark that these streets were named so
because they were once veins of gems.  The were hollowed out after years
of struggle leaving tunnels all over this area, a mage cast a very powerful
spell and created this section of the cavern.  The air is stuffy and moist
here.

of your reach above you.  It illuminates a sign that says 'The Gemstone.'

make out bits and pieces of conversation.

your head, glowing softly.  You look up and just see darkness, as if the
orbs didn't do anything.  An impenetrable field of black.

air smells of thousands living in a confined space with little fresh air.  The
air itself is moist and warm.  Sounds assault your ears, not just the buzzing
of people. but also agonized screams.  The shadows seems to speak of
death.  Welcome to the Underdark. 

The north and south is Sunrise, to the east is the entrance and to the west is
the Slaver's route and farther down, the market area.

The Gathering Place~
You are in the north west corner of the gathering place.  It is here that the
denizens of the Underdark come to meet to discuss business.  The lighting
here is dimmer than in most places.  Dark shapes seem to blend in and out
of the shadows.  Somehow the sounds of the city do not invade this place
so it is quiet enough to discuss without shouting.  The square is basically
clear but the dimness makes it impossible to see farther than 10 feet, thus
making it perfect for meetings of a discrete manner.  It seems as if some
orbs have stopped working.

North is the Slaver's Route, the meeting place continues east and south

muffled and distorted making it impossible to understand them.  Dark
forms wander at the edge of your vision, you can't tell if it your
imagination or reality.

here.  The only illumination is from your light source.  No sounds reach
your ears only your breathing and the blood gushing through your body. 
Everything seems to be distyle, nothing looks real.  You feel isolated
from society as a whole, ignored, worthless.  There is nothing to live for,
people whisper in the shadows, plotting the downfall of the world. 
Nothing can stop it, there is no point.  How can you as an individual make
a difference?  For a moment, these words form in the air "Welcome to the
darkside" you feel empty and drained.  No life stirs within, a chill
threatens to overcome your entire being.

The Slave's Square~
You are in one of the most oppressed regions of the Underdark.  It is here
that the capitalist dream has become totally realised.  The oppression and
repression of those who should be free is evident in everything that stands
in this square.  Stocks to hold the bad slaves, a guillotine to kill the slaves
that stand up for their rights.  The slaves are reduced to animals in this
square.

To the north is the Slaver's route, east and south lies the square

execution.  The ground is clean, with dark brown spots here and there.

smell of decaying corpses reaches your nostrils every now and then.  The
ground has dark brown stains on it.  The cruel reality of slavery can be felt
by your soul, causing is to ache to own and manipulate other beings.  You
can realise this desire to the west.

Sunrise~
You stand on sunrise the eastern most street in the Underdark.  The street
name is a joke on those surface dwellers who may crave the sun.  Sunrise
travels along the eastern cavern wall.  The Underdark is a huge city
compared to midgaard.  The city that was founded has grown to fill the
cavern and thrives in the dark.  Over half the people who live here can see
in the dark, the floating orbs were placed for the surface dwellers so they
could kinda see.

sounds of the city bounce of the cavern wall to the east and find their way
into your ears.  The smell of sweat engages your nose.  A dark forbidding
enters your head, the shadows begin to come alive.  Always, just out of

now is about 2 times larger than Midgaard.  This is the meeting place of

cast spells to allow you to hear the past, the present and the future.

You are standing at the western edge of the city just before the cavern
wall.  The buzz of the people is almost non-existent here.  This part of the
city like most of the city isn't very well lit.  A solitary glowing orb floats
casting a thin circle of light on the ground.  As with all sections of this
street, this part has been dedicated to a god, Silence.  As soon as you
realise this, you understand why this section of the city is so quiet. A statue
of a githzerai seems to be kneeling to a statue of Silence.

were enslaved by the mind flayers, there they were scarred for all eternity.
The githzerai is human in height and weight.  Most githzerai are strong,
and very capable with mental powers.  This statue is very lifelike, and it's
eyes seem to glow in the weird lighting of the orb.~
E
statue silence~
This is a statue of the god of agility and speed.  He is dressed totally in a
black ninja outfit.  In one hand he wields a tiger's claw the other hand
seems to glow.  You tap the hand and no sound comes out.  On pedestal
there is a note that reads

    Silence is both provider and destroyer, to be blessed by him is to           
be blessed indeed.

You take one final look at this impressive almost life like representation of
Silence and notice that it's eyes glow purple and seem to be watching your
every move.

the denizens of the Underdark built a road dedicated to them.   This
section of the road honours Garion and his true understanding of the fabric
of life.  Garion with his foresight to bring people together so they can
defend themselves from their enemies and unite for a common goal. 

The street goes on east and west.

Street of the Gods, Calliope~
You are walking along the street of the gods.  The street is of exquisite
craftsmanship.  The road turns to cobble stones, which are bright red and
yellow, in honor of Calliope.  You can feel a reasuring presence that surrounds
you with happiness and delight.  In the middle of the street there lies
a huge black obsidian ball.

The street goes on south and west.

This ball reflects your light as you come closer to get a better look.
The ball looks to be flawless and perfect, much like the immortal who
it was crafted for.  The blackness of the obsidian is so deep that it
causes your light to be absorded dimming the street.

this name is very obvious.  All around you more shadows then there should
be form.  Everything seems to be cloaked in it's own shadow.  The light of
the orbs and from your light source does nothing to illuminate the area.

would wander a road like this, but down here, many of the denizens of the
Underdark like the shadows thus they walk this road frequently.

East the road of shadows goes on.  West the road of shadows meet Azurite.

cast a huge spell along this road to give it this affect.  Whatever the reason
is, you can barely see anything around you.

You have heard rumours that a very strong group of worshippers live in
the Underdark, and you also heard that they attack any who enter their
place of worship....

be so thick that even the noise of the city does not penetrate it.  To the
north, the darkness clears up considerably.

North is the beginning of the street of Gods.  East and west the road of
shadows stretches onwards.

You stand at a turning point of the alley.  It is deathly quiet here.  The
darkness bears down on you.  The air is cool and moist causing you to
shiver.  You have heard that death lives in this alley, one of the reasons
why the citizens of the Underdark do not venture here.

To the east and north the alley continues, west is a dark door.

entire cavern was filled with veins of gems and precious metals.  It was
first mined by the duergar who lost it to the drow.  Much later a mighty
wizard came to the area and created a huge cavern from the many tunnels. 
Where the mighty veins once were now only roads exist.

Before the Underdark was built, the entire area was a huge mine of
different precious stones.  Azurite has left it's mark on the street.  The

darkness and death.  Although death is still easy to come by, the lighting
here brighten everything up.  The street is clean and glows in the light.

road, so there is no hidden threat (unless invisible).  The glowing orbs here
seems to flicker on and off, but even with this inconsistent lighting, the

Dark Tunnel~
You stand in a dark tunnel.   You light source illuminates a cleanly cut
tunnel.  You seem to be standing where it ends. On the wall you see
scribbled in blood:

Progress only if thee canst be seen or if thou art powerful 
The air is dry but cold.  The floor is even without any marks of tools.  The
walls are straight without any indication that mining tools have carved this
tunnel, only to the north are there any marks at all.

standing side by side here.  The floor has levelled off and has been worn
smooth by the dragging feet of the slave flocks. You stand just before the
Underdark.  The Underdark is a huge city that rivals it's surface counterpart,
Midgaard.  From what you have heard, anything goes in the Underdark.  A
dangerous place at best, only those who have had at least ten levels of
experience should venture into it.  On the wall to the north are a series of 
markings that you can't make out at this distyle.

A huge door stands to the west, the way to the surface is up.

The following has been scratched into the wall:

This is the city named the Underdark.  It was created by a crazy mage
years ago, and has prospered here below Midgaard.  For some reason, the
mage cast a mighty spell that cursed the entire city preventing people from
recalling out of it.  This makes it a perfect place to sell slaves and buy
slaves.  Although most think it as being lawless, there is a code and this
code is enforced by huge floating eyes.

Good luck,

You are standing in a large spacious hallway.  The floor is made of a

walls are made of what you think is jade, but it could just be a thin layer of
jade.  The green seems to fade to black as it goes lower to the ground.

scattered all along the ground.  The room is about ten feet by ten feet.  It's
almost impossible to walk thanks to all the broken wood on the ground.  A

as if it can be opened.  South is a small door.

is black and the walls are dark grey.  The hall is about fifteen feet wide
and the ceiling lies about thirty feet above your head.
