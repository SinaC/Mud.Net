Kate's Diner~
The smells of baking bread and simmering stew lead you dancing through
the doorway of the diner.  No greasy spoons to be seen here-- the
booth walls are covered in casual paisleys; the chairs are carved wood,
rescued from garage sales.  Most tables have chess or backgammon boards
carved and painted on their fingertip-smooth tops.  The refrain of some
musical or other from the 1930's blends with the dusty golden light and the
wonderful smells to put you completely at ease.  A huge picture window
looks out over the Midgaard River, and a doorway leads north onto the dock
and the South Bank river landing, while the main entrance to the south
returns you to Austral Square.
On most days you will find Kate here, testing a batch of stew or brewing
a special pot of cinnamon coffee, eerily just in time for your arrival
Pull up a chair, perhaps play a game, and take time out to talk.

As you walk in, a sudden gust of wind enters the shop and sends several
scraps of paper fly around the room.  You blink as the dust you've stirred

with old pieces of parchment, stacks of books, and odd scraps.  A desk with 
slightly less clutter than the rest of the shop is in front of you.  A scroll 
case full of scrolls is behind the desk.  A bookcase is to the right of you,

full of Melancholy's trappings from her adventuring days.  On a small table

As you enter the abandoned warehouse your eyes blink violently to
adjust to the almost total darkness.  You wonder where the windows are
as you step into a mud puddle in the middle of the floor.  As your eyes
adjust, you realize that there are mud puddles all around the room, and
this is some weird version of windows.  In a flash of revelation, you
realize that you've entered the Temple of Stupid.

The Temple Of Thoth~
You are in the southern end of the temple hall in the Temple of Thoth.
The temple has been constructed from giant marble blocks, eternal in
appearance, and most of the walls are covered by ancient wall paintings
picturing gods, giants and peasants.
   Small doorways lead to the east and west.
   Large steps lead down through the grand temple gate, descending the huge
mound upon which the temple is built and ends on the temple square below.
   A small plaque is on this wall.
