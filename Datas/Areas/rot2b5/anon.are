The Temple of Anon~
You are standing before the Temple of Anon, a truly majestic structure
constructed from pure marble. Tall Corinthian columns flank an impressive
set of bronze-bound oaken portals, which are never shut save in times of
trouble. Through these doors you can glimpse the majestic interior of the
Temple. Atop the pillars rests a plinth bearing an incredibly well-crafted
frieze which depicts the Immortals of RoT at work creating the World.
A broad, tree-lined avenue called "Victory Parade" runs past the Temple.

Marvelously sculpted likenesses of the Immortals of RoT line the aisle
of this sanctuary of the Gods. Tapestries on the walls depict their victories
over their enemies, and many of the treasures they acquired on such campaigns
are also displayed here. There is a magnificent altar fashioned of purest
obsidian to the north, chased with gold and partially covered with white
cloth. Behind this stands the healer, who will tell you how he can help you
if you look at him.

Valiant Street~
You have entered a rather seedy area of town, the slums that line the eastern
half of Valiant Street being legendary the world over. A haven for thieves,
assassins, backstabbers, footpads and murderers of every description, it is
a place where a quick mind and a quicker blade will mean the difference
between life and death. You quickly duck the contents of a chamber pot being
emptied into the street by someone in a higher building, and, cursing, move
on.

it, you notice a complex network of interconnecting tunnels more than big
enough for you to wander through, but the grate seems to be welded tight.

eating the brains of other sentient species, and you'll probably understand
why there are very few non-Vampires in this place at any particular time...

what better place to do this than in their Guild Bar?

standing next to you says- "It looks a lot better than it tastes...". Most
of the food has probably been sitting under those hot lights for a couple

"Now my charms are all o'erthrown, and what strength I have's mine own;
 which is most faint; now, 'tis true, I must be here confined by you, or
 send to Naples. Let me not, since I have my dukedom got and pardon'd the
 deceiver dwell in this bare siland by your spell; but release me from my
 bands with the help fo your good hands. Gentle breath of yours my sails
 must fill, or else my project fails, which was to please. Now I want spirits
 to enforce, art to enchant; and my ending is despair, unless I be reliev'd
 by prayer, which pierces so that it assaults mercy itself and frees all
 faults. As you from crimes would pardon'd be, let your indulgence set me
 free". (The Tempest, Epilogue)

You are heading along the northern half of the battlements on the eastern
wall. Peering over the crenelations, you shudder as you gaze upon the
desolate wastes of the southeast plains. You cast your eye about to try and
spot something more pleasing, but only see the old marsh and the acid forest.
Charming terrain.

You are heading along the huge northern wall of the City of Anon. This wall
extends for at least twice the distyle of the east and west walls,
protecting the vulnerable northern aspect of the city from the constant
attacks by warring raiders from the northern plains. Peering about, you see
little of note, save the dark stretch of Mirkwood. Who knows what adventures
may be found in there...?

of refectories that have been filled with disposable lunch bags made in a tiny
nation somewhere near Angkor and have been left to rot as a result of rabid
imperialism and soothsayers telling numberless lies to irritated masses who

Insanity~
Screeching, creaking preachers on antiquated pennyfarthing bicycles suddenly
dismount and enter a quaint English pub seconds before a sudden explosion
rends them to pieces as you pass and you find yourself dodging a shower of
gore and you curse yourself for forgetting to bring your umbrella.

Screaming children are abducted by monstrous creatures from a failed daytime
soap opera while their parents are distracted by a baby-eating bishop who
delights them with cute impressions of famous people in between his regular
devourings of hapless infants scarcely old enough to be out of the cradle.

Vicious dogs tear each other apart in a small pit while grown men bet huge
wads of money on the outcome and a strange monkey giggles insanely from atop
a high pile of unwanted clothing too good to give to charity and too poor to
sell for a decent price so they are left to rot.

Screaming Octopii demand to be put back in the water as they are dragged off
by wicked old men with large baseball bats and pith helmets toward an evil-
smelling bakery where they are considered a delicacy and then there is a
sudden explosion and everyone is rained with dying salmon that John West
rejected.

You see a tea party staffed by villainous serfs with large axes who promptly
decapitate anyone stupid enough to complain about the service except for a
large hare wearing a silly hat with the price tag still attached whom they
seem to revere and you whom they seem to ignore.

"Hey! I didn't order this!"

Hot air balloons crowded with curious fruit bats soar high below the bottoms

daisy chains and dancing around a maypole he stole from some kids in another
land.

lurch toward him in an attempt to force him to end this madness, but he grins
and disappears.
