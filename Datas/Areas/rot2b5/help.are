~
-1 PLATINUM GOLD SILVER MONEY~

idgaard's economy is based on platinum, gold and silver coinage (and the
lowly copper, which you as an adventurer are far too proud to carry).
Platinum coins are worth 100 gold coins.  Gold coins are worth 100 silver
coins.  Gems can be bought to alleviate weight problems from the
idgaard jeweller, he charges a mere 10% more than they are worth.
~
-1 DEPOSIT WITHDRAW BANK BANKS~

Usage: deposit <amount>    Deposit platinum into your account.
       withdraw <amount>   Withdraw platinum from your account.

There are currently four banks within the realms, each of which keep
thier own record of accounts, and thier own business hours.

All banks require deposits and withdraws to be made in multiples of
50 platinum, with the exception of closing out an account that contains
less than 50 coins.

If you are pkilled, there is a chance that your killer could end up with
a passbook in your name for one of your accounts.  This gives that player
the chance of successfully robbing your account.  See 'help rob' for
more info on passbooks and how to protect yourself.
~
-1 ROB PASSBOOK~

Syntax: rob <amount>    Steal platinum from another's bank account.

Normally passbooks do not exist in the game, but in the event of a pkill,
there is a chance that the killer will be given a passbook for one of the
bank accounts of his victim.  A random percentage of the victims balance
is encoded into the passbook, along with thier name and the name of the
bank.  But, the only information available to the killer is the name of
thier victim, not an amount or bank name.

Passbooks can not be given to other players, and are destroyed when dropped
or when you are killed.  They will also expire after two days.
Passbooks MUST be used at the correct bank, (you have a 1 in 4 chance),
and attempting to rob the account of more than the amount encoded into the
passbook will cause a robbery to fail.
Regardless of whether the robbery fails or not, a passbook may only be
used once, and will not be returned by the banker.

To use a passbook, hold it in your hand while in a bank, then use the
rob command: rob <#>

Your victim does not have to be in the game for a robbery to be
successful, they will be notified the next time they enter the
realms.

If someone has a passbook to one of your accounts, you can invalidate
the passbook by making a deposit or withdraw to that account, even if
it's a zero amount.
~
0 BRIEF COMPACT~

Brief and compact help set your display options for the game. Typing brief
toggles on and off the showing of room descriptions when you move around
(considerably reducing the text to be processed), and typing compact 
removes the extra blank line before your prompt.
~
0 DAMAGE~

The following are the damage messages, and the max amount of hp damage
for each message:
	0	miss		4	scratch
	8	graze		12	hit
	16	injure		20	wound
	24	maul		28	decimate
	32	devastate	36	maim
	40	MUTILATE	44	DISEMBOWEL
	48	DISMEMBER	52	MASSACRE
	56	MANGLE		60	DEMOLISH
	75	DEVASTATE	100	OBLITERATE
	125	ANNIHILATE	150	ERADICATE
	greater than 150 = UNSPEAKABLE
	Max damage for any weapon is 5400
	The game will take any over that amount 
~
-1 DEAF~

The deaf toggle turns off incoming tells, helpfull if you are being bombarded
by messages from other players.  You can still use reply (see 'help reply') to
reply to people who were telling you before you went deaf, although you
cannot reply to a deaf person unless you or they are a diety (it's mostly 
useful for sending a quick "I'm being spammed so I went deaf" message to
a person).
~
-1 AFK~

Typing AFK puts your character in a tell-saving mode as follows: any tell
to you is stored in a special buffer, and can be seen later by typing
recall.  This is useful when you need to leave the mud for 5 or 10 minutes,
but don't want to miss tells.  AFK shows up in your prompt until it is
turned off.

Tells to link-dead players are stored in a similar fashion, and can also be
seen by typing replay (unless, of course, the character logs off before
reading them).
~
-1 PROMPT~

Syntax: prompt
Syntax: prompt all
Syntax: prompt <%*>
 
PROMPT with out an argument will turn your prompt on or off.
 
PROMPT ALL will give you the standard "<hits mana moves>" prompt.
 
PROMPT <%*> where the %* are the various variables you may set yourself.

		%h :  Display your current hits
		%H :  Display your maximum hits
		%m :  Display your current mana
		%M :  Display your maximum mana
		%v :  Display your current moves
		%V :  Display your maximum moves
		%x :  Display your current experience
		%X :  Display experience to level
		%p :  Display your platinum held
		%g :  Display your gold held
		%s :  Display your silver held
		%a :  Display your alignment
		%r :  Display the room name you are in
		%e :  Display the exits from the room in NESWDU stance
		%S :  Display the current stance you are in
		%c :  Display a carriage return (useful for multi-line prompts)
		%P :  Display the fighting stance your pet is in
		%Q :  Display how many hit points your pet has

		%R :  Display the vnum you are in (IMMORTAL ONLY)
		%z :  Display the area name you are in (IMMORTAL ONLY)
 
Example:  PROMPT <%hhp %mm %vmv>
        Will set your prompt to "<10hp 100m 100mv>"
 
~
-1 ALIGN ALIGNMENT~

Alignment is an expression of your attitudes on life and how you react
to situations. There's good, neutral, and evil alignment. Your alignment
is affected by the alignment of the foes you kill; kill an evil monster
and your alignment shifts towards good, kill a good one, and you head
towards the dark side of things.

Alignment is expressed in numbers from 1000 (pure good) to -1000 (pure evil),
with 0 being true neutral. Most creatures are neither wholly evil nor wholly
good and have alignment scores between 500 and -500. You can check your
alignment by typing SCORE. Spells such as DETECT GOOD, DETECT EVIL, and KNOW
ALIGNMENT will show you the alignment of others.

Alignment affects what equipment you may wear, weapons you may use, how
creatures react to you, experience gained, and, in some cases, what exits
you see.  The Temple of Thoth houses recall for good and high-neutral aligned
characters.  The Temple of Belan is home to those of evil and low-neutral
alignment.  Equipment that is not suited to your alignment will be "zapped"
off of you when you try to wear it. If you are of good alignment, on occasion,
Thoth will protect you from harm in battle (usually from teleport spells),
but Belan, being evil, leaves his followers to fend for themselves.

Should you wish to change your alignment in some way other than fighting
oppositely-aligned foes, you will pay dearly.  Go to the church in Midgaard
near Clan Road and either REPENT ALIGN or CURSE ALIGN at the appropriate
priest for the alignment you wish to become.

~
-1 MEMBER~

Syntax: member <char>          Invites or removes a member from your clan.
        member <accept|deny>   Accept or Deny an invitation to join a clan.

The first syntax of this command may only be used by the clan leader.
You may not invite a player who is already in another clan.

If you have been invited to join a clan, you may use the ACCEPT option
to actually become a member of that clan.  Use the DENY option if you
do not wish to join the clan in question.
~
0 DEATH~

When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the Temple
of Midgaard.  Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,
together with all of your equipment.

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is two-thirds of 
the way back to the beginning of your level.

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).
Only the player who died, or someone in the same group, can retrieve objects
from a player's corpse.

~
0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~

Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need a set 
amount of experience points for each level based on your creation points.

You gain experience by:

    being part of a group that kills a monster

You lose experience by:

    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of certain spells
    dying

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment
versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed
lately; and some random variation.
~
0 COLOUR COLOR ANSI~

Syntax: colour              Toggles colour mode on/off
        colour list         Lists the available colours and channels
        colour #            Sets your default colour to #
        colour <channel> #  Sets the channel colour to #

Use the list option to view a list of all the channels you can set a color
for, along with the color numbers to use for channels and the default color.

Using a number as the only argument will set your default color to this
number. (Default color is the color most text is displayed in)

Using a channel name as the first argument and a number as the second argument
will set this channels color to the number. for example:
       colour gossip 13
This will change the gossip channel color from the default bright blue to
bright magenta.

You may also talk in colour; the format is like this: the 'escape character'
to specify a colour is the left handed brace '{{', following that you should
use one of the following numbers,

         {x{{0     reset, returns to default

         {r{{1     red     {m{{5     magenta
         {g{{2     green   {c{{6     cyan
         {y{{3     yellow  {w{{7     white
         {b{{4     blue    {D{{8     grey{x

For brighter colours, use the shifted numbers: {R!{G@{Y#{B${M%{C^{W&{x
When using colour, it looks better if you finish the line with whatever
colour it would normally be in, such as a gossip, the colour is magenta, so:
                {mLope gossips '{ghello,{r world{m'{x
        looks better than:
                {mLope gossips '{ghello,{r world'{x

Colour is courtesy of Lope from Loping Through The MUD.

~
0 COLOURS COLORS~

The following colors are available to be set as either your default, or
on a channel.

     0 - Reset           9 - Bright Red

     8 - Grey           17 - None

The Reset(0) and None(17) options are different depending on how you
are using them.
    If setting your default text color:
       Both 0 and 17 will turn off any default color, reverting back
       to your terminals default color.
    If setting a channel color:
       0 will reset the color back to the games default.
       17 will set the color to your default text color, or to your
       terminals default color if you have no default set.

You may change the default color for the following channels:

auction   - The auction channel
cgossip   - The clan gossip channel (global)

0 PET PETS~

You can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may own only one pet at a time, after 
the old one dies you may purchase a replacement.
~
0 FLAG FLAGS~

The following are the description flags for players and mobiles:
      {x[{yV{DH{cC{bT{wP{CI{rF{BL{RE{YG{WS{GQ{x]
Where:
       {yV{x = Invisible
        {DH{x = Hiding
         {cC{x = Charmed
          {bT{x = Translucent (pass_door)
           {wP{x = Faerie Fire
            {CI{x = Ice Shield
             {rF{x = Fire Shield
              {BL{x = Shock Shield
               {RE{x = Evil
                {YG{x = Good
                 {WS{x = Sanctuary
                  {GQ{x = Quest

The following are the description flags for equiptment:
      {x[{yV{RE{BB{MM{YG{WH{GQ{x]
Where:
       {yV{x = Invisible
        {RE{x = Evil
         {BB{x = Blessed
          {MM{x = Magical
           {YG{x = Glowing
            {WH{x = Humming
             {GQ{x = Quest

You may switch to the old format for flags (as used on other
muds) at any time with the 'long' command.
~
0 LONG~

The LONG command will affect the way you see special flags on other
characters and equipment.  With the long flag set, you will see the
flags much as you do on other muds, most of them as (Aura)'s.
Without the long flag (default), you will see any flags within
a much shorter table.  See 'HELP FLAGS' for the shorter tables.
~
0 TICK~

any of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.
~
0 !~

Syntax: !

! repeats the last command you typed.
~
0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~

Syntax: north
Syntax: south
Syntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.
~
0 CAST~

Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.
~
0 EXITS~

Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).
~
0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~

Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>
Syntax: put  <object> <container>

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and
'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.
~
0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~

Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).
INVENTORY lists your inventory.
~
0 COMPARE~

Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>
 
COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.
 
COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.
 
COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.
~
0 FINGER~

Syntax: finger <name>
The finger command will tell you the last time a player logged off
the system.  The entered name must match the players name completely,
and cannot be abbreviated.
~
0 FLEE~

Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.
~
-1 DONATE CDONATE~

Syntax: donate  <object>
        cdonate <object>

The donate command will transfer an object from your inventory to the
donation pit.  If you are a clan member, the cdonate command will donate
the object to your clans donation pit, otherwise, it will work the same
as a normal donate.  Some objects may not be donated, such as quest items,
cursed items, and sub-issue gear.
~
0 EXAMINE LOOK~

Syntax: look
Syntax: look    <object>
Syntax: look    <character>
Syntax: look    <direction>
Syntax: look    <keyword>
Syntax: look in <container>
Syntax: look in <corpse>
Syntax: examine <container>
Syntax: examine <corpse>

LOOK looks at something and sees what you can see.

EXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' followed by 'LOOK IN container'.
~
0 ORDER~

Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

ost charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.
~
0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~

Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.
~
0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~

Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.

New characters do have have the ability to use GTELL, TELL, and REPLY
except in a limited capacity until they reach level 10, or until a god
intervenes on thier behalf.
~
-1 NOTE NOTES CHANGES NEWS PENALTY IDEA WEDDINGS UNREAD~

The notes on ROT replace the bulletin boards and mail systems found on many
other mud.  The following options are usable:

reading notes:
note list	: show all notes (unread notes are marked with an N)
note read	: either by number, or read next to read unread notes
note remove	: removes a note that you wrote or are the target of
note catchup	: markes all notes as read

writing new notes:
note to		: sets the to line (playername, clanname, immortal, or all)
note subject	: sets the subject for a new note
note +		: adds a line to a new note (i.e. note + hi guys!)
note -		: remove a line from a note in progress
note clear	: erase a note in progress
note show	: shows the note you are working on
note post	: posts a new note. This MUST be done to post a note.

When you log in, you will be informed if there are unread notes waiting. Type
note read to scroll through them one at a time.

Five other note directories exist, these are ideas, news, changes, weddings,
and penalties (gods only).  They are used the exact same way, for example
idea read 5 will read idea #5.  Posting to the news, changes, and weddings
boards is restricted.
A seperate note directory exists for posting mud addresses, see HELP MUD
for the commands for posting to this base.
The 'unread' command can be used to show your unread notes on all the note
spools.
~
-1 MUD~

The mud addresses database is the only place you are authorized to post
an ad for another mud.  Only users above level 10 (in first tier) are
authorized to post to this base, though all users may read the ads.
Unlike the other note bases, private mail cannot be sent on this base,
all users have access to read all ads posted.  Also unlike other bases,
the game will temporarily remove your character from the realms while
you enter the necessary data, because of this, you may not post an ad
while you are fighting or stunned.

reading mud ads:
mud list        : show all mud ads (unread ads are marked with an N)
mud read        : either by number, or read next to read unread ads
mud remove      : removes an ad that you wrote
mud catchup     : markes all ads as read

writing new mud ads:
mud post        : sends you into the interactive ad creation.

The interactive ad creation will ask you for the following information:
   Mud Name,  Mud Code Base,  Mud Address,  Mud Port,  WWW Page
A blank answer on any of the first four will abort the ad.
Tildes are allowed in the WWW Page field, but will be removed
from all other fields.
~
101 SIGN~

The SIGN command will create a floating sign with your own text.
The main use for this is for creating hint signs during a quest.

sign -		: remove a line from a sign in progress.
sign clear	: aborts the current sign.
sign show	: shows the sign you are working on.
sign save	: creates the new sign in the current room. (this
		  MUST be done last)

TITLELOCK will prevent the system from changing your title each time
you advance a level.
~
0 WIMPY~

Syntax: wimpy
Syntax: wimpy <number>

WIMPY sets your wimpy value.  When your character takes damage that reduces
your hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically attempt to flee.
You will only flee if your character is not in a wait state -- i.e. has not
been using combat commands like cast, trip and bash, and has not been
tripped or bash by an enemy.

WIMPY with no argument sets your wimpy value to 20% of your maximum hit points.

Some monsters are wimpy.

~
0 BUY LIST SELL VALUE~

Syntax: buy   <object>
Syntax: list
Syntax: sell  <object>
Syntax: value <object>

BUY buys an object from a shop keeper.
When multiple items of the same name are listed, type 'buy n.item', where n
is the position of the item in a list of that name.  So if there are two
swords, buy 2.sword will buy the second. If you want to buy multiples of
an item, use an * (buy 5*pie will buy 5 pies).  These can be combined into
(for example) buy 2*2.shield, as long as the * is first.  

LIST lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.
List <name> shows you only objects of that name.

SELL sells an object to a shop keeper.

VALUE asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.
~
0 SACRIFICE~

Syntax: sacrifice <object>

SACRIFICE offers an object to your god, who may reward you.
The nature of the reward depends upon the type of object.
~
0 SCROLL~

Syntax: scroll
Syntax: scroll <number>

This command changes the number of lines the mud sends you in a page (the 
default is 24 lines).  Change this to a higher number for larger screen
sizes, or to 0 to disabling paging.
~
0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~

Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap      <target>
Syntax: zap

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.

These commands may require an item skill to be succesful, see the help entries
on the skills scrolls, staves, and wands for more information.
~
0 CONSIDER~

Syntax: consider <character>

CONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character.
Of course, it's only a rough estimate.
~
0 FOLLOW GROUP~

Syntax: follow <character>
Syntax: group
Syntax: group <character>

FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just FOLLOW <yourself>.

GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.

You may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within five levels of
your own.
~
0 VISIBLE~

VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
making you visible again.
~
0 QUIT RENT SAVE~

Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: RENT ... not!
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and object.  The game saves your character every
15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving.  Typing save
will block all other command for about 20 seconds, so use it sparingly.
(90+ players all typing save every 30 seconds just generated too much lag)

Some objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game 
you will be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.
~
0 RECALL /~

Syntax: RECALL

RECALL prays to your god for miraculous transportation from where you are
back to the Temple of Midgaard.  '/' is a synonym for RECALL.
If you are a member of a clan that has it's own reincarnation room,
your god will transport you there, unless you have been labeled a thief
or killer.

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for fleeing),
and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for fleeing).  This
chance is based on your recall skill, although a 100% recall does not 
insure success.

RECALL costs 1/4 of your movement points.

RECALL doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a
curse may not recall at all.
~
-1 SPLIT~

Syntax: SPLIT <silver> <gold> <platinum>

SPLIT splits some coins  between you and all the members of your
group who are in the same room as you.  It's customary to SPLIT
the loot after a kill.  The first argument is the amount of silver
the split (0 is acceptable), the second gold (optional), and the
third platinum (optional).
Examples:
split 30 	--> split 30 silver
split 20 50	--> split 20 silver, 50 gold
split  0 10	--> split 10 gold
split  5  0  10 --> split 5 silver, 10 platinum
~
0 STEAL~

Syntax: STEAL coins <character>
Syntax: STEAL <object> <character>

STEAL attempts to steal coins, or an object, from a character.

There are penalties for using STEAL on other players.

In order to STEAL successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~
0 PRACTICE~

Syntax: PRACTICE
Syntax: PRACTICE <skill|spell>

PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.

PRACTICE with an argument practice that skill or spell.  Your learning
percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a some maximum between 80% and 100%,
depending on your class.  You must be at a guild master to practice.

The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will
have each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you
do use them.
~
0 TRAIN~

Syntax: train <str int wis dex con hp mana>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class, and several
initial training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).

It takes one training session to improve an attribute, or to increase
mana or hp by 10.  You receive one session per level.

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more
practice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.
In the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train
WIS and CON both to 18 before practising or training anything else.
~
110 CHLEVEL~

Syntax: chlevel <character> <level>

CHLEVEL sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  CHLEVEL
may also be used to demote characters.
~
110 TRUST~

Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~
110 WEDPOST~

Syntax: wedpost <character>

WEDPOST sets or removes the wedpost flag on a mortal player.  This flag
allows a mortal to post to the wedding announcement message list.
~
109 ALLOW BAN PERMBAN~

Syntax: allow   <site>
	ban     <site> <newbies|all|permit>
	ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list, if the remover is of equal or higher level than the banner.

A site may have all players, new players, or non-permitted players (set
by editing the player file) banned, by changing the argument after the site.
*s may be used to ban either by suffix (*.edu), prefix (labmac*), or 
content (*andrews*), but be careful not to accidently lock out too many
sites with a wildcard.  Bans do not save unless the permban command is used.
~
109 REBOOT SHUTDOWN~

Syntax: reboot
	shutdown

Reboot shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of fifteen seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

Shutdown shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.
~
108 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~

Syntax: wizlock
	newlock

Wizlock and newlock both block login attempts to ROT. Wizlock locks
out all non-gods (i.e. level less than 101), except for link-dead players who
are returning.  Newlock only locks out new character generation, typically
used for preventing a spammer from returning.  Wizlocking should be avoided,
and newlocking should be accompanied by mail or a note to the imps.

A god must be at least Supreme level to wizlock the game.
~
109 DENY WIPE~

Syntax: deny <name>
        wipe <name>

DENY and WIPE lock a character out of a game permanently, rendering their
character name unusable.  They may only be removed by editing the pfile, for
this reason freeze is usually preferred.

If a player is DENY'd, they will be sent a message telling them so, then
will be forced to quit.  They will then receive a message telling them
they are denyed access any time they try to connect.

If a player is WIPE'd, they will receive no message, and will be immediatly
disconnected.  They will immediatly be disconnected any time they attempt
to connect, with no explanation.
~
107 DISCONNECT~

Syntax: disconnect <name>

Disconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the telnet
prompt.  This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and annoying
players.
~
106 FREEZE~

Syntax: freeze <name>

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a 
troublemaker is usually a better option than they deny command.
~
109 DUPE~

Syntax: dupe <character> <name>

DUPE will add or remove a dupe account name to a list kept on the players
account.  Anytime this player connects, all characters on their dupe list
will be forced to quit (except immortals).  This should be used only on
those who flagrantly violate the rule against bringing in more than one
character at a time and using one character to build a second.  Entering
a dupe that is already on the list will cause it to be removed.

Using DUPE <character> without the second argument will list that
characters current dupes.
~
0 QUEST~

Syntax: quest          Turns your quest flag on.
        quest <on|off> Imms only, turns global quest flag on/off.
	quest mob <mobile> Imms only, toggles the quest flag on mobiles.

The quest flag identifies players participating in a quest.  It also
protects the player during a quest, by making them non-pkill.

The quest flag can only be set when the global quest flag is on, and
can not be turned off until you either quit and relog, or the quest has
been completed.  Upon the completion of the quest, the flag will be
turned off automatically when the global quest flag is removed.

The quest flag on mobiles is visible only to immortals.  Any mobiles
with this flag set are immune to gate, summon, and portal, and objects
they carry cannot be detected with the locate spell.  Though this flag
can be set on mobiles without the global quest flag on, the above
immunities are only active while the global flag is on.  This flag
is automatically removed from all mobiles when the global flag is
turned off.

When the global quest flag is on, a message will be displayed at the
bottom of the 'who' list.

Rasp! Whoa, the baddest spell in a magical classes arsenal by far,
this spell depends on mana for its effectiveness, the less mana the 
victim has the less damage they take, the more mana the more damage,
then the player gets a mana reward of percentage of the victims mana.

~
0 AUTOQUEST~

Certain mobiles in the game will allow you to go on quests to recover an
item or kill another mob. To go on a quest, you must be in the same
room with a questmaster. when you successfully complete a quest, you will
receive a certain number of quest points. These points may be saved up and
used to buy incredible items from the questmaster.

 The QUEST code comes from {YVassago's quest snippet{x.

 The QUEST command is used for information about your current quest, to
request a quest from a questmasterequest a quest from a questmaster, etc. Commands are as follows:

QUEST POINTS - Gives your current number of quest points. This command
mayh be used anywhere.

QUEST INFO - If you are on a quest, this will remind you who or what you
are after.

QUEST TIME - Gives the amount of time remaining on your current quest, or
the amount of time until you can request another quest. This command may
be used anywhere.

QUEST REQUEST - Petitions the questmaster to send you on a quest. If you
accept the quest, you will be given a realtime limit (in minutes) in
which you must complete the quest. If you are on a quest to kill a
creature, when you come across that creature you will see a [TARGET]
notice before it. This is the creature you are to kill.

QUEST COMPLETE - Once you have completed your quest and recovered the item
or killed the mob or whatever. you must return to the questmaster who sent
you on the quest and use this command. If you have successfully completed
your quest, he wiyour quest, he will reward you with gold and quest points. once you
complete a quest you cannot request another for 10 minutes (real time).

QUEST LIST - Displays the list of fabulous items for sale by the
questmaster. These items are not ableto be bought with gold. They must be purchased
with quest points.

QUEST BUY <item> - purchases an item from the questmaster and deducts the
cost of the item from your quest points.

QUEST QUIT - This is to quit a quest that is to hard for you to perform
there is a penalty for quiting a quest you lose 10 global quest points
and a small wait till the next one.

QUEST AQUIT - The penalty for quiting this quest is the same as 'quest request'
type, if you are level questing you also must perform a additional quest for 
the dungeonmaster to get your new level quest, and he will not even acknowledge
that you did it when you finish, but he will send you on your level quest.


The quest system here is the most advanced anywhere, therefore 
it also is harder to learn, but once you do learn it it's easy,
'aquest' is for normal quests, that can be done at the same time 
as 'quest request' and sometimes can even be the same mob, if you 
are level questing then aquest turns into a quite different quest 
the item you will be sent to retrieve is unique and that is how 
you know its a level quest, the system has been thouroghly tested, 
and should be bug free, so that means if its not working for you 
then its your fault for not doing it right. If however you do find 
a bug please report it so we can fix.

0 STYLE~

Syntax: stance <stance>

In combat, the stance of the fighter plays a very important role; you 
can't just stand there and exchange blow for blow unless you are very 
confident of your ability.  Each fighting stance has advantages and 
disadvantages, the basic outline of which follows:
SERPENT: A very fast and aggressive stance of combat, concentrating on 
striking your opponent before they have the chance to avoid or block you.
CRANE: A wide, sweeping stance of combat, which concentrates on a very 
strong blocking defence.
CRAB: A low, defensive fighting stance which uses agile footwork and 
rolling with attacks in order to reduce your injuries.
ONGOOSE: A light-footed stance, which relies on leaps and acrobatics to 
ensure that by the time your opponent makes their attack, you've moved 
out of the way.
BULL: A low aggressive stance which concentrates purely on physical power.

Gaining experience in stance skills are gained by fighting mobiles, and
skill levels are rated from 0 - 200, 200 being the max skill level in
that stance. To see your current skill level in stance type: sskill

0 AUTOSTYLE~

Syntax: autostance <stance>

Autostance lets you set a stance that will automatically set you
into a stance when you engage in combat.                             
Simply type autostance <stance> ie: bull crab dragon mongoose crane
swallow monkey tiger mantis and so-fourth. To see
additional help type autostance.

~
0 ADVANCEDSTYLE~

Syntax: combat <stance>

Advanced stance can be learned after you have become a grand master in 
two normal stance.  These stance are much better than the others.
ANTIS: Requires CRANE and SERPENT before it can be learned.  This stance 
combines a very strong defence with lightning fast counter attacks.
DRAGON: Requires BULL and CRAB before it can be learned.  This stance 
uses very powerful attacks, as well as protecting the fighter from injury.
TIGER: Requires BULL and SERPENT before it can be learned.  Probably the 
most aggressive of all the stances, this stance utilizes very powerful and
lightning fast attacks.
ONKEY: Requires CRANE and MONGOOSE before it can be learned.  The only 
affect of this stance is to completely nullify the advantages of your 
opponents stance.
SWALLOW: Requires MONGOOSE and CRAB before it can be learned.  This is 
the most defensive of all the stances, combining agile dodges with the 
ability to 'roll' with an attack, helping prevent injury.

0 STYLETABLE~

The following table is a rough comparison of stances, giving a value 
between 10 and -10, where the higher the number the better your chance of 
victory.  Cross-reference your stance from the left with your opponents 
stance from along the top.  Please remember these are only rough

~
102 MQUEST MPOINT~

Syntax: mquest <object>
        mpoint <object>

QUEST sets or removes the quest flag on any object.  A mortal character
may only carry ONE item with the quest flag set.

POINT sets or removes the questpoint flag on any object.  Any character
who then uses this object will receive a quest point.  The questpoint
flag is automatically removed from an object by the system once the
quest point has been given.
~
103 FORCE~

Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command, except of course delete.

Below level 107 (Deity) force can only be used on mobiles, and force all is
unavailable.  You also cannot 'force orc murder hugo', for example. 

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.
This is typically used for 'force all save'.
~
102 SOCKETS~

Syntax: sockets
	sockets <name> 

SOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including 
users in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the 
channel number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed in 
merc.h: 0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.

The optional name argument shows the site of a player, or optional can be used
to identify switched gods (i.e. socket orc shows the name of anyone switched
into an orc).
~
104 LOAD~

Syntax: load mob <vnum>
	load obj <vnum> <level>

The load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to 
duplicate strung items and mobs).  The vnums can be found with the vnum
command, or by stat'ing an existing mob or object.

Load puts objects in inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they are
put in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god. Old
format objects must be given a level argument to determine their power, new
format objects have a preset level that cannot be changed without set.
(see also clone, vnum, stat)
~
104 STRING~

Syntax: string obj <field> <string>
	string mob <field> <string>

The string command changes the various strings associated with an object or
mobile.  A full list of fields can be viewed by typing string obj or string
mob.  Sorry, multi-line strings are not yet supported.
~
105 NOCHANNEL NOCLAN NOEMOTE NORESTORE NOSHOUT NOTELL NOTITLE~

Syntax: nochannel <character>
	noclan    <character>
	noemote   <character>
	norestore <character>
	noshout   <character>
	notell    <character>
	notitle   <character>

NOEMOTE, NOSHOUT, and NOTELL are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively.
Characters who are noshout'ed or no'telled will also not receive those
forms of communication.

The NOCHANNEL command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the victim
from using any of the channels (gossip, cgossip, Q/A, music) on the game.
Nochannels usually result from swearing or spamming on public channels.

The NORESTORE command makes a player immune to the restore command.
This is used to punish players who constantly ask for restores from
immortals.

The NOCLAN command makes a player unable to join pkill-type clans.
This is used to punish players who are known to cause serious troubles
with pkilling.

The NOTITLE command makes a player unable to set their own title.
This is used to punish players who use the title for swearing,
threats, etc....
~
103 TWIT PARDON~

Syntax: twit   <character>
        pardon <character>

TWIT sets the Twit flag on a player.  When set, the twit flag causes
any mobiles in a LAW room (all of Midgaard) to attack the player,
and the shopkeepers will not sell to the player.  Also, any player may
attack and kill a player with the twit flag, whether they can normally
pkill or not.

PARDON will remove the Twit flag if set.
~
102 PURGE~

Syntax: purge
	purge <character>

Purge is used to clean up the world.  Purge with no arguments removes all the
NPC's and objects in the current room.  Purge with an argument purges one
character from anywhere in the world.

Purge will not get rid of PC's, or objects or mobiles with a NOPURGE flag
set (i.e. the pit, the fountain, shopkeepers, Hassan).  Mobiles may be
purged if they are called directly by name.
~
106 RESTORE~

Syntax: restore <character>
	restore room
	restore all

Restore restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the
target character.  It also heals poison, plague, and blindness.

Restore room (or restore with no argument) performs a restore on every player
in the room, restore all does the same for all connected players. Restore all
is only usable by creators and implementors.  Restore should be used sparingly
or not at all.
~
107 SLAY~

Syntax: slay <character>

Slay kills a character in cold blood, no saving throw.  Best not to use this
command on players if you enjoy being a god.
~
104 TRANSFER TELEPORT~

Syntax: transfer <character>
	transfer all
	transfer <character> <location>
	transfer all         <location>

Transfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,
to your current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans all 
should almost never be used, as 100 players popping into one room can have
horrible effects on slow links. Teleport is a synonym for transfer. 
~
102 RECOVER~

Syntax: recover <character>

Recover transfers the target character to their default recall point.
You may only recover a character who is either cursed, or is stuck in
a no-recall area.
~
104 AT~

Syntax: at <location> <command>

At executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of
a mobile, or as the name of an object.

At works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the
command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your
location).
~
102 ECHO GECHO PECHO~

Syntax: echo  <message>
	gecho <message>
	pecho <character> <message>

These commands all perform similar functions.  Echo sends the message to
all characters in the same room as the user, with no indication of who sent
it.  Gecho does the same for all players connected to the game, and pecho
sends the message to the player specified as the target.  Any higher-level
god will see a prompt in front of your message, informing him or her that it
is an echo.
~
102 GOTO~

Syntax: goto
        goto <location>

Goto takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.

Goto with no argument will take you to your default location if you
have one set. (see GSET)  If used in this manner, your pet will be
transfered with you.

You may not Goto a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present. Some other rooms are barred to players below a certain
god level.

Implementors can use the violate command to get into private rooms.
~
102 GSET~

Syntax: gset <vnum>

Gset allows you to set the default location for the goto command to
take you to.
~
102 HOLYLIGHT INVIS WIZINVIS~

Syntax: holylight
	wiznvis <level>

Holylight is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

Wizinvis takes a level argument, and will mke you invisible to all players of
a lower level than your invisibility level.  It defaults to the maximum
(your level) if no argument is given.  Wizi 110 characters are totally 
invisible.
~
102 INCOGNITO GHOST~

Toggling your incognito status will hide your presence from people outside the
room you are in, but leave you visible to those who are with you.
Toggling your ghost status will do the exact opposite, making you invisible
to anyone in the same room as you, but visible to those outside the room.
While ghost is set, you will still appear visible to all characters in the
game through the 'who' command. (depending on your wizinv level)
Both take a level argument similar to wizinvis, people at that level
or higher can see you regarless of location.
These flags are mutually exclusive, turning on one will automatically turn
the other off.
~
102 MEMORY~

Syntax: memory

emory reports the size of your mud.

The 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and objects,
not the number of instances currently in the game.

The 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings.  These strings have
a maximum limit, which is also shown.

The 'Perms' line shows permanently allocated memory blocks.  There is no limit
on the number and size of these blocks.
~
102 VNUM~

Syntax: vnum <name>
	vnum <obj or mob> <name>
	vnum skill <name>
	vnum area

Vnum finds all objects and mobiles with a particular name, and prints out
the results.  Use vnum obj or vnum mob to limit the search.  This vnum is
very useful for loading. Vnum skill returns the skill number (for set) and
the slot number (for making new zones) of a skill name. Vnum area lists
all areas and their range of vnums.
(see also load)
~
102 STAT~

Syntax: stat <name>
	stat mob  <name>
	stat obj  <name>
	stat room <number>

The stat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or room
within the game.  Without a class argument, the command will return a object
(if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does), or a room 
(if a number is  given).  Stat room with no argument stats the room you are
standing in.  Stat can be used to find room vnums for goto.
(see also goto, transfer)
~
102 MWHERE~

Syntax: mwhere <name>

where shows you the locations of all mobiles with a particular name.
~
104 PEACE~

Syntax: peace

Peace causes all characters in a room to stop fighting. It also strips the
AGGRESSIVE bit from mobiles.
~
102 POOFIN POOFOUT~

Syntax: poofin  <message>
Syntax: pooffout <message>

The standard messages for goto are 'arrives in a swirling mist' and
'leaves in a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with messages of
your own choosing using the poofin and poofout commands.  These messages
must include your name somewhere in the string.

Poofin and poofout only show to characters who can see you.
(see also goto)
~
109 PROTECT~

Syntax: protect <character>

Protect is used to protect a character from unwanted snooping.  Removing 
protected status from a character WILL be seen by that character.
~
105 LOG SNOOP~

Syntax: log   <character>
	log   all
	snoop <character>

Log <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like Freeze, it is a permanent character toggle.
Logs may only be used by creators and implementors, and should be accompanied
by mail to the implementors.

Certain commands (Password) are protected against log.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

Log all logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you tell the imps.

Snoop shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time. Try to respect privacy.

Snoop yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
~
103 SWITCH RETURN~

Syntax: switch <character>
	return

Switch switches you into the body of another character (who must not
already have a descriptor, e.g. you can't switch into a PC). You also cannot
switch into link-dead PCs.

Return returns you to your original body.
~
102 IMMTALK :~

Syntax: immtalk <message>
	immtalk

Immtalk sends a message to all immortals.  : is a synonym for immtalk.
Using this command with no argument turns off the immortal channel (or
turns it back on).
~
-1 WIZNET LEVNET~

Syntax: wiznet 
	wiznet show
	wiznet status
	wiznet <field>

Wiznet is sort of an immortal news service, to show important events to
the wiznetted immortal.  Wiznet by itself turns wiznet on and off, 
wiznet show lists all settable flags (they are not detailed here), 
wiznet status shows your current wiznet settings, and wiznet <field> toggles
a field on and off.  The events should be self-explanatory, if they are not,
fiddle with them a while.  More events are available at higher levels.

Levnet is identical to wiznet, except it is available to all those of
at least second tier, and only heroes in the first tier.
Only newbie logons and level messages are displayed for levnet.
~
-1 WIZHELP~

Syntax: wizhelp

Wizhelp provides a list of all the immortal commands.
~
105 WIZSLAP~

Syntax: wizslap <character>

Wizslap is a mild punishment used against an unruly character.  This
teleports the victim to a random room, and sets the weaken spell on
them for a period of 5 game hours.
~
108 RENAME~

Syntax: rename <character> <new name>

Rename will allow you to change the name of a player.  This should be
used on characters whose name others find offensive, or names that the

target character by 1 for every 8 levels of the caster. It may also be

are more effective against demonic beings).

This spell reduces the character's to-hit roll and save versus spells.

~
0 'DISPEL MAGIC' CANCELLATION~

Syntax: cast 'dispel magic' <character>
        cast 'cancellation' <characte>
 
Both of these spells remove magical effects from the target.  Dispel magic
has a reduced chance of working, and is considering an attack spell.
Cancellation can only be used on allies, but is much more effective and does
not provoke attack.  Unfortunately, the spells do not discriminate between
harmful and benign spells.
 
The chance of dispelling is based on the level of the spell. Permanent spells
(such as mobile sanctuary) are much harder to remove.  Not all spells may
be dispelled, notable examples are poison and plague.
~
0 EARTHQUAKE~

Syntax: cast 'earthquake'

This spell inflicts damage on every enemy character in the room.
Beware that other characters who are not yet fighting may attack
you as a result!
~
0 EMPOWER~

Syntax: cast empower <spell>

This spell magically binds another spell to either a scroll, or a
potion, depending on the type of spell being bound.  This spell
can be quite costly in terms of mana, since not only does it use
mana for this spell, but also for the spell being bound.
~
0 'ENCHANT WEAPON'~

Syntax: cast 'enchant weapon' <weapon>

This spell magically enchants a weapon, increasing its to-hit and to-dam
bonuses by one or two points.  Multiple enchants may be cast, but as the
weapon grows more and more powerful, it is more likely to be drained or
destroyed by the magic.  Also, every successful enchant increases the level
of the weapon by one...and there is no turning back.
~
-1 'ENCHANT ARMOR'~

The enchant armor spell imbues armor with powerful protective magics. It is
not nearly as reliable as enchant weapon, being far more prone to destructive
effects.  Each succesful enchant increases the plus of the armor by 1 or 2
points, and raises its level by one.
~
0 'ENERGY DRAIN'~

Syntax: cast 'energy drain' <victim>

This spell saps the experience points, mana, and movement points of its
target.
~

~
0 POISON~

Syntax: cast poison <victim>
Syntax: cast poison <object>

This spell reduces the strength of the victim by two, as well as reducing the
victim's regeneration rate. It may also be used to poison food, drink, or
a weapon in a fashion similar to envenom ('help envenom'), but with 
drastically reduced effectiveness.
~
0 RESURRECT~

it into a zombie.  Zombies are considered pets, and cannot be created if
you already have a pet.

0 ANIMATE~

mobiles.  These are not considered pets, so there is no limit to the

be conjured if you already have a pet.  The conjure spell requires a
special source of power to be used, similar to the portal and nexus
spells, though not the same source.
~
0 VOODOO~

Syntax: cast voodoo
        voodoo <pin|trip|throw>

The voodoo spell will turn a sliced-off body part of a PC character into
a voodoo doll.  Hold the body part in your hand when casting.

The voodoo command can be used to inflict pain, trip, or throw another
player accross the room (or sometimes out of the room).  Hold the
voodoo doll in your hand when using the command.

Voodoo dolls in your name can be destroyed with the help of the priests
in the church, but at a hefty price.

After the successful use of a voodoo doll, your victim will be immune to
the effects of another use for 1 tick.

{RWARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING{x
Having a voodoo doll in your inventory makes you vulnerable to
{RPKILL{x by the victim of the curse, with {RNO{x restrictions
of level, tier, or clan affiliation.
Because of this, you cannot give a voodoo doll to another person,
or use the transport spell on a doll, they must pick it up of thier

vanish.

Syntax: cast ventriloquate <speaker> <message>

This spell throws your voice, making it appear that some other object or
character in the room is saying your message.  Victims who make their saving
throw will know that someone is using ventriloquism, but not who.  Victims who
fail their saving throw will think that the object or character really did say
your message.
~
0 WEAKEN~

Syntax: cast weaken <victim>

This spell reduces the strength of the victim by two points.
~
0 'WORD OF RECALL'~

Syntax: cast 'word of recall'

This spell duplicates the built-in RECALL ability.  It is provided solely for
erc-based muds which wish to eliminate the built-in ability while still
providing the spell.
~
0 'ACID BREATH' 'FIRE BREATH' 'FROST BREATH' 'GAS BREATH' 'LIGHTNING BREATH'~

Syntax: cast 'acid breath'      <victim>
Syntax: cast 'fire breath'      <victim>
Syntax: cast 'frost breath'     <victim>
Syntax: cast 'gas breath'
Syntax: cast 'lightning breath' <victim>

These spells are for the use of dragons.  Acid, fire, frost, and lightning
damage one victim, whereas gas damages every PC in the room.  Fire and
frost can break objects, and acid can damage armor.

High level mages may learn and cast these spells as well.

-1 ROT~

RoT v2.0
RoT is a ROM2.4 derived mud, which is originally based on the Merc 1.0 code.
The RoT modifications to the ROM source are copyright 1996-1999 by Russ Walsh.

The following people contributed to the RoT flavor of the ROM base code:

Areas --
    Eriana
    Artema
    The C.A.W.
    Fnor
~
-1 ROM~

ROM started in early February 1993, using Merc 1.0 code. In July of 1993,  
ROM II was started, eventually replacing the original ROM.  ROM was up for
a little over a year, after which the code (version 2.3) was released,
and various other ROM muds were started, including Rivers of Mud under
a new management (Zump's ROM), at rom.org 9000.

Alander's current project is Tesseract, the latest version of the ROM code.
It can be found at hypercube.org 9000.

The following people contributed to the ROM flavor of the merc base code:

Socials --
    Kelsey and Liralen

New, Improved Valhalla --
    Liralen

Puff's new special proc and improved poofin/poofout code --
    Seth

aps and map shop --
    Ezra, Regnan (Olympus)

Nirvana zone --
    Forstall (mobiles rewritten by Alander)

ob Factory --
    Pinkfloyd (originally written for ROM, mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Geographically correct Midgaard (tm) --
    Alander

Ideas and playtesting --
    Thousands of dedicated mudders around the world

Beta testing --
    Ken Blosser, Doug Araya, and Sherene Neil all helped with bug reports
    and suggestions, saving a lot of headaches

New Thalos area was donated by Onivel of Jedi, who was also the originator
of the ASCII flags used in the zone files

ROM 2.4 was developed during my time with Moosehead mud, and the release
shares many of the features I wrote while I was there.  Additional code
was written by Seth Scott (the new poofin/poofout), and many contributions
and ideas from the Merc list were used. 

The new features of 2.4 were largely produced in bull sessions with
Gabrielle (my wife) and Brian Moore, without whom this release wouldn't
have happened.  In particular, the new privacy code, furniture, and
wiznet are largely the results of Gabrielle's ideas.

Changes to the standard diku mob and object format, as well as the changes
to Merc 2.1 source code, were done by Alander over many a late night of
hair-pulling. Hope you enjoy it.

(my apologies if anyone was forgotten in this list)
~
-1 IMMORTAL IMMORT GOD~

'Immortal' (often, simply, 'immort') refers to players who have reached
the highest attainable levels in the game.  Here, anyone of level 102
or higher is an 'immortal.'  Immortals are capable of exceeding the
usual game rules, in more drastic and pervasive ways as levels increase;
examples range from teleportation and invisibility to mortal sight to
creation of objects, removal of a player's privileges (channels,
ability to move, or even ability to log in), and ability to promote
players to immortality.

Since immortals can wreak havoc with game balance, they are (ideally)
a carefully-chosen and policed group.  An absolute rule of immortal
behavior is that no immortal can aid or assist any player without
explicit permission from the higher ranks; in other words, please
don't ask an immortal to help you kill a mob, gather EQ, etc, or
you'll likely be either politely or rudely refused, or referred to
this file.

The duties of immortals, and even the very reasons for their existence,
are topics of continual and heated debate in various MUD forums, and are
fraught with misconceptions, poor examples, and outrageous hypocrisies. :)

102 JOBS~

This is a partial list of what a god of any given level should be doing. It is
not complete yet.

Angels:(102-104)
Angels and higher level gods may not assist mortals directly in any way.  
An Angel's main job is to help with quests (via switch), or possibly run
small quest of their own -- but the rewards should be minimal.

Deities:(105-106)
Deities have two main roles: reimbursement and quest running.  Be skeptical
on reimburses, don't just hand out every piece of gear.  I suggest limiting
reimbursements to 10 items at a time, and make sure that you do not load things
at too high a level (new format items have hard-coded levels, so are not a
problem).  vnum and stat are useful for this.  You can draft Angels to help you
run a quest, and please note that quests should NOT have huge rewards -- the
main point should be to have fun.  Deities have no business trying to enforce
rules -- the most you should do to a player is a NOCHANNEL or similar light
punishment.

Gods:(107-109)
Gods can run quests just like Deities, and it's nice to do reimbursements too.
However, the main role of a God is keeping the peace.  Gods can enforce (but
not create rules), using the various NOTELL-class commands, as well as deny,
purge, freeze, and ban (but be careful with these commands!)  Gods are expected
to help make the mud run more smoothly, power trips are strictly verbotten.

Not fufilling the roles of your office can result in demotion or deletion.
~
-1 PKILL PKILLING PKILLER 'PLAYER KILLING' PSTEAL PSTEALING 'PLAYER STEALING'~

Player killing and player stealing are allowed to all clan members 
(including loners), provided the victim is is within 10 levels of the
character and is also in a clan.
	
	A very unique feature of this mud is the pk gear system.
If your a pk'er then this will be something you want to understand.

	When you get a pk a pk token may appear (like 7 out of 8 times)
the first one will be a black token or gold token, they each give types
of bonus' when you hold them (in the future there will be many more)
currently if you hold a gold token and get another pk then it may 
generate a new token that will appear in your inventory, also it will
take the gold token requiring you to keep making pk's so you'll have
a supply of gold tokens, the black and gold tokens have timers the black 
shorter than the gold the gold lasts a very long time, each time you
get a new peice of pk gear it will allow you to get the next piece of
gear, at the moment there are gold, black, a black pk ball, and amulet
that shows who killed who, battlearmor, and a wand of rasp.
	That basically covers it so go out and see what you can get!

                         **********************
                         ** The Rules of ROT **
                         **********************
 
1)  Do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals.
    This includes transferring/summoning them to aggressive mobs.
 
2)  Do not cheat for ANY mortal in ANY way, especially your own. 
    Unless of course you LIKE deletion. Yes this includes tanking,
    healing/restoring, casting protection spells <armor, sanct>,    
    and softening up or altering mobs.
 
3)  Do not transfer or summon mobs to mortals or mortals to mobs.
    They have legs, if they want to kill a mob, they can easilly
    go there themselves.
 
4)  DO NOT kill the shopkeepers for any reason at ALL.
 
5)  DO NOT use reboot.  <--- Note, simple English.
 
6)  Do not give out free equipment.  You don't need to win brownie
    points with the mortals.  Quest are fine but handing out items
    isn't.
 
7)  A note on quests: Quests are a good thing, more or less, BUT 
    do not give out overly extravagant prizes.  Exercise some 
    common sense here folks.  Do not load items more than 4 levels
    below their normal level (i.e. no level 5 ogre gauntlets).
 
8)  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you 
    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore
    their priveleges.  They are being punished for a reason.
 
9)  Do not try to overrule each other.  
 
10) Trusted mortals:  Do not use your god powers to help your mortal
    character.  If you do, your trust will be taken away.

See HELP WIZRULES for a more detailed list.
~
102 WIZRULES~

1. Thou shalt be an Immortal first, and a mortal second.

2. Thou shalt be a "mortal" in judgements, lest mortals judge against you.
(i.e. try to remember what it's like to BE mortal and have IMMs impose
punishment...how would YOU like to be treated as a mort?)

3. Thou shalt not play more than one immortal and ONE mortal character at
the same time.

4. Thou shalt not stay invisible if: 

        a) You are the ONLY IMM online
        b) You are the only IMM "live"
        c) Another IMM needs your assistance dealing with a problem
        d) A mortal needs help

5. Thou shalt not ever be invisible and/or AFK at the same time as all
other IMMs.

6. MORTALS COME FIRST: Do NOT ignore them when they need help, have
questions, etc.; if need be, drop whatever you are doing to assist them. 

7. If you are unable to handle a mortal question or dispute, refer them
to the next higher IMM online. If no one is available to assist them, have
them email an IMP.

8. We do have a sort of "pecking order" here. Any IMM of a higher rank
than you has final judgement in situations. If there is a dispute over
this, please address an IMP; do NOT take it to public channels.

9. If you have a dispute over IMM procedures, or feel that another IMM is
doing something inappropriate or "illegal", either attempt to speak with
them about it, or talk to an IMP.

10. Thou shalt not modify stats, restring or change the stats on any weapon,
or otherwise modify any mortal character involved with a clan. This includes
your own characters as well as your friends, your mortal's clan mates, etc. 

11. Do not be exclusive with any mortal character. Don't help just your
mortal's clanmates, your own mortal, etc...spread yourself around.

12. Thou shalt not harass mortals, lest thy hands be removed, or your
physical being be frozen by the Wrath of the Gods. The *OCCASIONAL* prank
is accepted...but do not be excessive. 

13. Thou shalt not reveal any character's dupes, whether they are IMMs or
mortals, unless they are problem characters.

14. Thou shalt {R*NOT*{x reveal "bugs" to mortals, lest they take advantage of
them...and get YOU in trouble.

15. Thou shalt not delete thyself in a rage, lest thou NOT be accepted back
into the bosom of IMMortality. 

16. Thou shalt NOT assist any character in pkilling in any way. This
includes, but is not limited to:

        a) Spelling up chars involved in pkill
        b) Using IMM powers to locate the target of pkill
        c) Using IMM powers in any way to assist or hinder anyone involved
           in pkill
        d) Retrieving corpses of anyone pkilled, unless agreed upon by the
           deceased AND the killer
        e) In ANY way intervene in a dispute over pkill, unless the involved
           parties are fighting on gossip or ASK for assistance.
        f) Re-equipping anyone pkilled

  Note: ANY special items, quest items, etc. CAN NOT BE RESTORED to anyone
        pkilled.

17. Thou shalt offer opinions/suggestions/ideas that in any way can modify
or improve the MUD. This includes suggesting new areas, spells, class
modifications, recommendations for IMM, etc. Please address inquiries to
an IMP.

18. Thou shalt report problems, questions, disagreements over policy,
disputes over IMM behavior and/or actions, etc. to the offending person
FIRST when appropriate, and to an IMP otherwise. Do not argue,
accuse, point fingers, or harass another IMM publically.

19. Thou shalt not publically dispute any decision made by the IMPs...if
you have a question, address it to them. 

20. Thou shalt ACTIVELY participate in MUD. As an IMM, you have to be here
and spend time helping mortals. If you want to be an IMM, don't disappear
for weeks or months, or you will not be an IMM when you return. On the other
hand, obviously we don't expect you to be here 24/7...but use some common
sense. In general, if you are gone more than three weeks without emailing
an IMP with a GOOD reason for your absence, you will be removed from the
wizlist and revert to being mortal.  Logging on wizinvis or going AFK
do NOT count as  "being online". If you want to be an IMM, you are expected
to BE an IMM. There are specific exceptions to this rule, mainly guest
immortals..you know who you are.

21.  Thou shalt not remove penalties imposed by another IMM without
consulting that IMM first. Check the penalty list; and ALWAYS post a
penalty when imposing a punishment. 

22. Thou shalt not publically question the decision of any IMM.

23. Thou shalt in no way hinder another IMM's quest, or assistance of a mortal.

24. Thou shalt obey ALL rules unless otherwise excused by an IMP.

~
-1 RULES~

These are the rules of ROT.  For other matters, use common sense.
For clan specific rules, see HELP CLANRULES.

* Limited player stealing or player killing. Join a clan if you want to do
  either.

* A member of a clan may kill a member of any other clan.

* A member of a clan may steal from a member of any other clan.

* If you join a clan, and someone either pkills you, or psteals from you,
  do not complain to the gods, or ask the gods to return your eq or do
  a corpse retrieval for you, as they are forbidden from doing so.

* Your presence here is a privilege not a right. Obey any orders from gods,
  and you will be fine.  Deletion does not require a reason, appeals are to
  be sent to the implementors.
 
* Sitting around idle with a client is hazardous to your health. If we catch
  you doing it, you will lose half your playing time.

* Watch your language in public areas and channels.

* No multiple logins, multiple playing, or helping your own characters with 
  other characters you own -- by any arrangment.
 
* No kill stealing.  This means you cannot attack a mob someone else is 
  fighting, unless they ask you to. Also avoid attacking fleeing mobs.

* Cheating will not be tolerated.  This includes accepting favors from gods
  and exploiting bugs. If you find a bug, report it, then do not use it.

* Do not ask a god to make you a member of a clan.  The request to add
  you to a clan must come from the clan leader.  Ask a member of the clan
  who their leader is.

* Changes to these rules are at the discretion of the immortals, and may be
  done without warning, notice, or even evidence of sanity. Walk softly,
  and carry a black stick.
~
-1 CLANRULES~

1. Do NOT join any clan until you investigate ALL clans.

2. Once you join a clan, you must STAY WITH THAT Clan. No switching clans,
abandoning your clan mates, etc.; the point of joining a clan is to use
TEAMWORK. That means when you get pkilled, you ask your CLAN MATES to
retrieve your corpse, re-equip you, help you avenge your death, etc. Do
not count on the IMMs for help.

3. Clanned characters are *not* allowed to pkill anyone in their own clan,
or anyone NOT clanned; nor are they allowed to kill members of non-pkill clans.

4. Clanned characters are NOT allowed to use edited equipment for pkill.
This does not include Clan EQ or Quest items, both of which are allowed.

5. If you get pkilled, you will *NOT* be reimbursed ANY eq by the IMMs;
this includes edited EQ, items of sentimental value, quest items, etc.

6. Clanned characters are not allowed to ask for or receive ANY kind of
IMM-related help; this includes corpse retrievals, spellups, assistance
locating chars, reimbursements, etc.

7. If you are a clan leader, you are expected to MUD on a regular basis.
If you do not actively play your character for three weeks, and have not
found a replacement, you will be removed as leader.

8. Clan leaders must be level 70 or above.

9. In order to form a new clan, you must follow these rules:

        a. Have FOUR people involved in forming the clan
        b. Have a PURPOSE for creating and maintaining the clan
        c. Find an IMM to sponsor you (this MUST be a level 103 or higher;
           they can not already be involved in sponsoring another clan)
        d. Have your area files READY TO BE INPUT. Type "help room" for
           more help.

10. You must ALWAYS have at least four members of your clan ACTIVELY
PLAYING the game. This means that if your membership drops to less than
four members for more than one week, your clan will be disbanded and dropped
from the list of clans.

11. As a member of a clan, you are expected to assist other members of your
clan. This includes spellups, corpse retrievals, levelling, etc.

12. If you reroll a clan leader into second tier, you must find three
current members of your clan to "sponsor" you back into the leader position.
The three members can email, note, or verbally give their nominations to
the Implementors.

~
0 SUICIDE DELETE~

Use the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be
available for use.  This command must be typed twice to delete a character,
and you cannot be forced to delete.  Typing delete with an argument will
return your character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the
first delete.  Second tier players should use reroll to recreate a
character, instead of the delete command.
~
0 REROLL~

The reroll command may be used by anyone on the mud.  This command is
similar to deleting and recreating your character, but for two major
differences:  It will not log you off, instead you will be sent directly
to character creation.  This command will reroll you back into your
current tier (see help tier) instead of forcing you to recreate in
the first tier (as delete would do).

This command NO LONGER moves you to the next tier, see HELP ADVANCE.

Because this command will put you back at level 1, with only newbie
gear, this command must be entered twice before taking effect.
~
0 ADVANCE~

The advance command may be used once you reach hero status.  This will
allow you to create a new character in the next tier.  A hero may only
use this once per hero, so if you want to create a second player in the
next tier, you must either create a new 1st tier character, or reroll
your hero and level back to hero.

Syntax: advance <new character name>

A new pfile will be created with the name you choose, and with your
current password, you may then quit and log into that character to
start creating it.

You must choose a new name for your next tier character.  This name is
subject to the same rules imposed upon your original character.  An imm
may require it changed if they feel it does does fit the theme or
restrictions of this mud.
~
0 TIER~

There are currently fourteen classes in ROT, split into three tiers.
1st tier classes:
   {Mmage  cleric  thief  warrior  ranger  druid  vampire{x
2nd tier classes:
   {Rwizard  priest  mercenary  gladiator  strider  sage  lich{x
3rd tier:
   Third tier is a multi-class tier, comprised of a primary class
   chosen from the 2nd tier choices, and a secondary class chosen
   from the 1st tier choices.

The second tier classes are notably stronger than the first tier
classes, but you cannot create a character in these classes until
you reach the hero level in a first tier class. (see 'help advance')

You DO NOT have to choose the second tier class that is in the same
slot as the first tier class, ie: a mage does not have to become
a wizard, you are given the option of choosing any of the classes.

Because of the strength difference between the tiers, player killing
and player stealing is level-offset between the tiers.

For third tier, you may not choose the equivelant 1st tier class
to your chosen 2nd tier class.  You will recieve all skills and spells
from both classes.  The cost of these skills/spells depend on the
skill/spell:  Thos you recieve only from either your primary class
({Rin red{x) or from your secondary class ({Bin blue{x) will cost the
same as they do in thier respective tiers.  Those that you recieve
from both classes ({Gin green{x) will cost the lesser of the two.
The level you attain these skills/spells follows the same rules
as above.

The strength of a skill/spell is also dependent upon which class
you recieved it from.  Those you recieve only from your primary group
will be at normal strength.  Those recieved only from your secondary
class will be slightly weaker than normal.  Those recieved from both
classes will be slightly stronger than normal, due to the extra
training it is assumed you had.
~
0 HEALER~

The healer decided to grab a quick buck, and now charges for his heals.  Some
services are still free to players of level 30 or below, however.  To see
a full listing of the healer's services, type 'heal' at his residence. To
receive healing, bring plenty of money, and type 'heal <spell>'.
~
-1 GAIN~

The gain command is used to learn new skills, once the proper trainer has 
been found. (Check New Thalos) The following options can be used with gain:

gain list:    list all groups and skills that can be learned
gain points:  lower your creation points by 1 (costs two sessions)
gain <name>:  add a skill or skill group, at the listed cost
gain convert: turns 6 practices into one training session
gain study:   turns 1 training session into 6 practices
gain quest:   turns 3 quest points into one training session

Gain uses training sessions, not practices. (see 'help train')
Gained skills and groups do NOT increase your experience per level or total
number of creation points. 
~
-1 RESTRING~

Syntax: restring obj <string>

The restring command is used to change the name of an object in your
inventory.  Only specific trainers have the ability to restring an object
for you (Check New Thalos), and charge you 8 quest points per item.

Restringing an object will only change the short name of the object, not
the long description or keywords associated with that object, so you will
still have to use the original keywords to use a restrung object.

For example:
    Object to be restrung is 'an imperial sword',

       > restring sword a battle axe

    This will now show up as 'a battle axe' in your inventory, and will use
    this string in actions:  '<char> wields a battle axe' or '<char> gets a
    battle axe'.

    Because the keywords of the object are not changed, to wield or
    manipulate this object, you will still need to use 'sword' or 'imperial',
    ie:  get sword     wield sword
~
102 CLONE~

Syntax:
  clone obj <object>
  clone mob <mobile>
  clone <name>

The clone command duplicates an object or mobile.  The level of item or mobile
that may be cloned depends on your level.  The target object or mob must be in
the same room as you, or in your posession.  Strung and set information is
preserved by clone, as well as any spell effects and container contents or
mobile inventory, except for items which are too high for you to clone.  
Strung extended descriptions on objects are not kept, however.
~
110 RANDCLAN~

Syntax: randclan

Randclan will move the entrances to all clan halls to new randomly selected
locations.  This is automatically done by the system at boot, and once per
day thereafter, but can be called by an implementor to correct any problems
in the choice of locations from the last automatic run.
~
0 SKILLS SPELLS~

The skills and spells commands are used to display your character's list
of available skills (or spells, as the case may be).  They are listed in
order of level, with mana cost (for spells) or percentage (for skills)
listed where applicable.
~
0 OUTFIT~

The outfit command, usable by levels 9 and below, equips your character with
a new set of sub issue gear (banner, weapon, helmet, shield, and vest), 
courtesy of the Mayor's warehouses.  Only empty equipment slots are affected.
~
0 AUTO AUTOLIST AUTOLOOT AUTOGOLD AUTOSAC AUTOEXIT AUTOASSIST AUTOSPLIT AUTOSTORE AUTOPEEK~

ROT uses varies automatic actions, to ease the boredom of always splitting
gold and sacrificing corpses.  The commands are as follows:

autolist  : list all automatic actions
autoloot  : take all equipment from dead mobiles
autogold  : take all gold from dead mobiles
autosac	  : sacrifice dead monsters (if autoloot is on, only empty corpes)
autoexit  : display room exits upon entering a room
autosplit : split up spoils from combat among your group members
autoassist: makes you help group members in combat
autostore : saves all tells during combat
autopeek  : will show inventory during a look <char> (with the peek skill)

Typing a command sets the action , typing it again removes it. 
~
-1 CLAN~

A Clan is a collection of players, united to follow and further
a common cause.  Each clan has rules and regulations, to find out
more about clans and their 'beliefs' type "help <clan name>".  Only
Clan members can kill or steal from other players.  To join a Clan
you must be level 25 or above and level 70 or below.  Second tier
players may join a clan starting at level 15.  Speak to the Clan
Leader about joining.  If you go Loner before level 70 you may 
join a Clan later.
   Joining a Clan is a dangerous step.  Many adventurers live to 
kill and torture others and chances are that your paths will cross.
   Clans may now choose to allow pkill or not, members of clans that
choose not to have pkill will be unable to attack other players, or
be attacked by others.
   Existing Clans may buy special rooms and mobiles by acquiring 
cubic zirconiums as payment.  To see room prices, type
"help prices".  New Clans may be formed by petitioning the immortals.
Please remember that their word is final on all matters not covered by
this help.

A list of current clans can be obtained with:  clan list
~
-1 PRICES PRICE~

~
-1 GATE~

The gate spell is a powerful transportation magic that opens up a portal 
between your character and another person or creature somewhere else in the
world.  This portal will transport you and any pet you might have, but not
other members of your group.  Monsters receive a save against gate, and
monster or players more than 3 levels higher than you can not be gated to at 
all.  God rooms, private rooms, and no recall rooms cannot be gated to, and
no recall rooms cannot be gated out of.  Finally, any god or hero is also 
immune to gate, as well as any player who has no summon set.  Clan members 
may not be gated to except by their fellow Clan members.
~
-1 AFFECTS AFFECT~

This command is used to show all the spells affecting your character. At
low levels, only the spell name will be displayed, at higher levels the

~
-1 ROOMS~

Clan Room may be bought using cubic zirconiums, see 'help prices'
for a list of the prices.  Only one clan room within an organization
may be set as a healing room. The price quoted for the mana/heal option
will set BOTH up to 200%, which is the max.

Any mail not following the guidlines above will be tossed in the trash.
~
-1 GUARDIANS~

[{RCLAN{x]
Gaurdians is a non-pkill clan which focuses on helping others as we help
ourselves.  Any race/class/alignment/sex/whatever is welcome as long as they
adhere the clan's morals. We are here to enjoy the game and to help others do
the same.  So if you are willing to help others, you wish to be part of a
family, and you want to have some fun...give one of our clan leaders a tell.

The clan leaders reserve the right to administer a quest to member hopefuls
before admitting them to the clan.  And remember, a sense of humor is a MUST!
~
-1 ANGELS~

[{RCLAN{x]
                       The Angels Creed

These are the principles every Angel must uphold at all times. The 
power of the clan is within' these principles, without which the clan has 
no power. For the real strength of the clan lies within its abiding members.

			honor	
		      -	      -	
		    -           -
		  -               -
 		-	            -  
	    truth- - - - - - - - -loyalty

These are the three principles every Angel has to live by. 

1. Honor
   
   Angels must honor themselves as well as uphold the honor of the clan. 
   This will help ensure that this clan and its members are of their word.
   Though this principle is at the top of the triangle, it would come 
   tumbling down like some walls of Jerico with out the other two 
   principles.

2. Truth

   Angels should be true to themselves, the clan leaders, and other clan 
   members. Here the truth will not set you free, diceat and untruths will 
   (set you free from the clan that is). 

3. Loyalty

   Last but certainly not least, loyalty. A loyal clan member can be ones 
   right hand man (or woman). Angels should always be loyal to the clan 
   leaders, its members and the IMM's. This also means being willing to do 
   whatever it takes to defend the honor of the clan.

These principles all form a triangle. One not being more important than 
the other but all of them needing each other to help make a well great 
Angel.
~
-1 IRONHAWX~

[{RCLAN{x]
The Society of IronHawx have been around for centuries.  Never
appearing until time of great need and always fighting on the side of
good.  They are non-bias towards race, gender, or class so All may request
an interview.  However, because of their secretive nature not much is
known about their initiation process.  All that can be said is that it is
a test.  Not just of physical prowless but of the power of the mind and if
you complete the journey you will be changed...forever.  If you think that
you are up to the tasks and have more than what it takes, speak with a
clan leader.
~
-1 KINDRED~

[{RCLAN{x]
The Kindred, as vampires all themselves, have spent countless centuries
preying secretly on humanity, cooperating uneasily amongst themselves
through a clandestine and Machiavellian social order governed by many
laws.  Preeminent among these laws is the Tradition of the Masquerade.
Disguised as humans, vampires have infiltrated and manipulated the very
history of the mortal world.

The only way to become Kindred is to be Embraced and be reborn.

There are many bloodlines within vampire society:

Toreador:  Members of this clan are thought of as artists and
           degenerates.

Nosferatu: These hideously deformed creatures use their influence to
           gain knowledge.  They are loners by necessity, but still
           manage to know more about the workings of Kindred society
           than do many of the most powerful vampire leaders.

Ventrue:   The most old-fashioned of the clans, the Ventrue are
           sophisticates who move in the highest social and political
           circles.

Brujah:    The Brujah are rebels; they make no secret of their
           disrespect for undead society and are often viewed as a force
           of chaos by other Kindred.

Gangrel:   The most earthy of Kindred, the Gangrel have close ties to
           Gypsy society.

Tremere:   This close-knit clan is known to have many arcane and magical
           skills.

alkavian: Members of this clan are insane, yet from madness may come
           wisdom and many Malkavians seem to glimpse hidden truths.

Caitiff:   These clanless, thin-blooded outcasts are high generation
           vampires, many generations removed from Akasha, who are
           somewhate uninvolved with the political structure of the
           Kindred.
~
-1 JEDI JEDIS~

[{RCLAN{x]
The Jedis have existed for thousands of years.
Now, they have entered this realm.
They are non-denominational, so all genders, races, and classes may be Jedi.
To be a Jedi, you must take a test, conducted by a [Jedi Master].
This will involve a fight in which fleeing 3 times is allowed, but death isn't.
In this fight, you may use any eq at your disposal(and any spells or skills),
but no pets, charmed mobs assisting, and no players helping out.
The Jedi clan is run internally by [Jedi Masters], who inturn answer to the
Jedi clan leader(s).
These people are not yet fully understood, and all that is known is that being
a [Jedi Master] is a thing to be proud of.
This is partially because very few people know much about them, and because
they are masters of a dreaded weapon, the Lightsaber.
To test for Jedi, consult a [Jedi Master].

Neutrality: 1. Neither good nor evil is served exclusively.
            2. It is right to keep to one's own business.
 
Balance: 1. Actions are to receive counter-actions.
         2. Representation will be as equal as possible.
         3. JUSTICE, not vengeance, is to be served.  Eye for an eye, etc.
 
Self-Control: 1. It is right to accept the consequences of one's own actions.
              2. It is right to bow to authority, not urge.
 
         The Way of the Wolf is...
                1. Strength through Alliance.
                2. Victory through perseverance.
                3. Power from cunning, skill, knowledge, and unity.
                4. Unity through equality of the individual, but respect of
                   authority.

-1 UNFORGIVEN~

[{RCLAN{x]
The Clan of Unforgiven is for everyone: any gender, race, align, or class.
To get into the Unforgiven you must:
        1. Get an initation test from one of Unforgiven's leaders.
        2. Do that test.
To stay in, you must:

                    possable.
        2. Do not engage in war without the leader(s) of Unforgiven telling
           so.

-1 DARKMIST~

[{RCLAN{x]
Welcome to Thoth, if your reading this you must be considering joining a
clan.  Right now you are asking yourself, what can Dark Mist offer me, well
let me tell you...
        1.)  We are dedicated to becoming the strongest clan on Thoth, this
means on individual level and as a whole.  We support each other in our
endevours to level to gain equipment and to retrieve corpses (should you
die.)
        2.)  We are building one of the greatest clan halls in exsistence,
what that means is you'll have a really cool place to call home.  We hope to
have high healing and mana regenerating inbuilt, our very own healer, a
special store to buy clan only items, and private clan member rooms.
        3.)  We use an inner clan rank system that goes as follows:
When you pass the entrance exam you become a Dark Mist Initiate or a[DMI].
You can then test for Dark Adept at any level, or [DA].
Upon attaining level 40 you can test for Dark Warrior or [DW].
Upon attaining level 80 you can test for Mist master or [MM].
Upon attaining level 101 you can test for Dark Overlord or [DO].

        So if you are interested in joing the best clan on Thoth send me a
note, and I will test you for entrance!

[{RCLAN{x]
Judges is the name, justice is the game.  Judges is a stricly non-pk clan.
We are here to help newbies, answer questions, and help keep things in order.
If you want to kill people and constantly worry about getting a watcher's
dagger in the back then join a different clan!  If you want to be sort of
lackadaisical and help others (and receive help) then judges is for you.
If you are an avid pkiller and your sick of listening to the whinning's of
you kills then take a break from the mayhem and join today!
~
-1 DWARF DWARVES~

Dwarves are short, stocky demi-humans, known for foul temper and great
stamina.  Dwarves have high strength and constitution, but poor dexterity.
They are not as smart as humans, but are usually wiser due to their long 
lifespans.  Dwarves make excellent fighters and priests, but are very poor
mages or thieves.  

Dwarves are very resistant to poison and disease, but cannot swim, and so
are very vulnerable to drowning.  They receive the berserk skill for free
(if warriors), and can see in the dark with infravision.
~
-1 ELF ELVES~

Elves are slightly taller than humans, but have a much lighter build.  They
lack the strength and stamina of the other races, but are far more agile,
both in body and mind.  Elves are superb mages and thieves, but have at
best fair talent as warriors or priests.

Elves resist charm spells most effectively, due to their magical nature.
However, they are burned by the touch of iron, and so are barred from the
use of iron or steel in their adventuring careers.  Elves are notoriously 
hard to spot, and so elven warriors and thieves receive the sneak and hiding
automatically. They may see in the dark with infravision.
~
-1 HUMAN HUMANS MAN~

Humans are the most common race in the world, and make up the majority of
adventurers. Although they have no special talents like the other races,
they are more versatile, being skilled in all four classes. Humans may
also train their primary stat higher than any other race, and are able to
gain more benefit from magical devices.
~
-1 GIANT GIANTS~

Giants are the largest of the races, ranging from 9-12 feet in height.  They
are stronger than any other race, and almost as durable as the dwarves.  
They aren't too bright, however, and their huge size makes them more clumsy
than the other races.  Giants make the best warriors of any race, but are
ill-suited for any other profession.

Giants resist heat and cold with nary a mark, due to their huge mass.  However,
their slow minds make them extremely vulnerable to mental attacks.  Giants,
due to their size and stamina, receive the fast healing and bash skills for
free. (Only giant warriors recive bash).
~
-1 PIXIE PIXIES~

Pixies are very much like the elves...and share with them a vulnerability
to iron weapons.  They also share the nature-loving attitude and peaceful
demeanor, but beyond this pixies reach an extreme.  They are extremely
magical creatures which, unlike elves, fly everywhere they go.  Their
wings are fairly redundant, as they don't really use them to fly.  It's
the sheer magical nature of a pixie that gives it it's special qualities.

They are a race of very small size, and because of their inquisitive
nature and mental power, tend also to be tinkerers and sometimes
pranksters.  While a pixie may be thousands of years old, almost all
of them act like human children...
~
-1 HALFLING HALFLINGS~

Halflings are a quiet folk who like to keep to themselves, and are not
often seen filling the role of an adventurer.  They would much rather
sit complacently by a fireplace enjoying a good book, good drink, and
good conversation.  They are, however, very adept thieves, and have the
mental capabilities to be quite powerful mages.  They are about half
as tall as the average human, thus the name halfling.  Because of this
small size and the fact that most devices are built to human proportions,
halflings are masters at lockpicking, disarming traps, and jewel craft.
They also have very easy access to pockets, and there is no door a
halfling can not open and slip through with the utmost of silence.
~
-1 HALFORC HALFORCS~

Halforcs are a cross between humans and orcs, dwarves and orcs, or sometimes
even giants and orcs.  These various combinations are almost always the result
of an orc raid on the habitation of one of those other races, and each type of
halforc is just as mean and hearty as the other.  They are also very agile,
and born athletes, however seldom is a halforc found that can even read or
speak coherently.  They are quite literally dumber than bricks, but there is
no more fearsome fighter around.

A halforc is a warrior, and if a halforc is not a warrior, then that halforc
is useless.  They can fight, and when it suits them they can also sleep, eat,
and fornicate, but that's it.
~
-1 GOBLIN GOBLINS~

Goblins are almost universally shunned because they are almost all natural
criminals, cutthroats, and killers.  Every crime boss or thief master is a
goblin, with very few exceptions.  They are extremely thrifty, known to
argue over a single silver piece, and will drop water in the desert before
dropping money. Goblins have diabolical minds, and few torture devices can
be named which a goblin did not think up.  They are extremely smart and also
have a knack for survival.  Stealth comes naturally to them, and their dusky
grey to green, sometimes even blue or black, skin tones make them hard to
spot at night.

Goblins are not really warlike, and don't really appreciate overt combat.
It's not their stance.  A goblin would much rather satisfy its sadistic needs
through thievery or betrayal than through honorable combat.
~
-1 HALFELF HALFELVES~

Halfelves are a cross between a human and an elf, usually due to the fact
that human armies sometime make raids on elf lands. Halfelves are very
nearly human, although they tend to be a bit more thoughtful, and less
physically powerful.  Unfortunately they are also more bitter, and much
more aloof than either the most secretive elf or the most secluded human
hermit.  They see themselves as unwelcome in either elf or human society
and as a result tend to lead solitary lives as wandering adventurers who
follow no real creed.

A halfelf is a natural loner, and most of them are rangers or druids,
communing with the nature that they love much as the elves do.
They have much better eyesight than humans, due to their elven ancestry,
but unlike elves are more inquisitive about the world around them, much
as humans are.  
~
-1 AVIAN AVIANS~

The avian race is a very secretive and mysterious one.  They are the size
of giants, towering over any human, but weigh about the same as an elf.
Their slight bone structure allows their wings to carry them as they fly
from place to place, but it also requires them to rely on mental prowess
instead of brawn for survival. Many speculate that they are a people who
evolved in the mountains, perhaps magically.  However they came to be,
they are fiercely religious, and worship a nature diety.  Most choose to
become druids since that allows them to be closest to their god, however
they do well in clerical magicks as well.  They have uncanny powers of
sight, and it is said that an avian can see everything you do. For this
reason many avians are hired as watchkeepers, and they make wonderful
explorers and missionaries.  Their amazingly unusual bodies, which
basically look like emaciated humans with wings, and the fact that they
are used to an isolated environment, makes them very susceptible to
disease and poison.  Many an avian has ventured out of his or her
homeland only to fall victim to one of the many plagues that ravage the
world at large.
~
-1 GNOME GNOMES~

Gnomes are to dwarves what pixies are to elves.  That is to say, they are
smaller, smarter, less-strong cousins.  Where dwarves are known for their
mental dullness but great wisdom, gnomes are known for quick minds and a
very analytical nature.  They are nowhere near as strong or hearty as
dwarves are, but are much the same, being creatures of earth who can't
swim (and thus drown easily like dwarves) and have eyes attuned to seeing
in the dark.  Where a dwarf would see a mine shaft and it's glittering
jewels, though, a gnome notices the girders and struts and supports within
the mine and contemplates ways to make them better.  Gnomes love technology,
metallurgy, and any other form of science.  This makes them natural mages,
possessing mental powers that rival elves.  They are not, however, a stealthy
race like elves, goblins, or halflings.  They are engineers, architects,
artisans, and sometimes workers of great magicks.
~
-1 DRACONIAN DRACONIANS~

The draconians are a fearsome race, and almost as secretive as the avians.
Like the avians, they can fly, and come from some not-so-well-known place
far away.  Unlike any other race though, draconians are not mammalian.
They more closely resemble lizards, snakes, and especially dragons.
They tower over even giants in size, reaching over 12 feet in height, with
leathery wings that can stretch to over 30 feet when extended, and can fold
up neatly on the back, causing no real hindrance in movement.  The sheer
size of a draconian DOES, however, cause problems, because most things in
the world are built with human size in mind.  Draconians are very strong,
and tougher even than dwarves.  Unlike most races that reach such large
proportions, they retain a keen mind, and make good mages as well as
warriors.  Because of their strange biology, and some degree of reptilian
nature, draconians are immune to almost all poisons and plagues.
~
-1 CENTAUR CENTAURS~

Centaurs are woodland beings who shun the company of men.  They dwell in
remote, secluded glades and pastures.  The appearance of a centaur is
unmistakable: they have the upper torso, arms, and head of a human being,
and the lower body of a large, powerful horse.
~
-1 GNOLL GNOLLS~

Gnolls are large, evil, hyena-like humanoids that roam about in loosely
organized bands.  While the body of a gnoll is shaped like that of a human,
the details are those of a hyena.  They stand erect on two legs and have
greenish grey skin, darker near muzzle, with a short reddish grey to dull
yellow mane.
~
-1 HEUCUVA HEUCUVAS~

The heucuva is an undead spirit similar in appearance to a skeleton, but
more dangerous and more difficult to dispel.  The heucuva appears to be
a humanoid skeleton of normal size.  The bones are covered by a robe that
is little more than tattered rags.
~
-1 KENKU KENKUS~

Kenku are bipedal, humanoid birds that use their powers to annoy and
convience the humand and demihuman races.  The typical kenku resembles
a humanoid hawk wearing human clothing.  Kenku have both arms and wings.
The wings are usually folded across the back and may be mistaken at a
distance for a very large backpack.  Height ranges from 5 to 7 feet.
The feathers are predominantly brown with white underfeathers and face
markings.  The eyes are a brilliant yellow.
~
-1 MINOTAUR MINOTAURS~

inotaurs are either cursed humans or the offspring of minotaurs and
humans.  They usually dwell in underground labyrinths, for they are not
confused in these places, which gives them an advantage over their prey.
inotaurs are huge, well over 7 feet tall, and quite broad and muscular.
They have the head of a bull but the body of a human male.  Their fur is
brown to black while their body colouring varies as would a normal normal
human's.  Clothing is minimal, usually a loin cloth or skirt.
~
-1 SATYR SATYRS~

Also called fauns, satyrs are a pleasure loving race of half-human, half-goat
creatures.  They symbolize nature's carefree ways.  Satyrs have the torso,
head, and arms of a man, and the hind legs of a goat.  The human head is
surmounted by two sharp horns that poke through the satyr's coarse, curly
hair.  The skin of the upper body ranges from tan to light brown, with rare
individuals (1%) with red skin.  A satyr's hair is medium reddish, or dark
brown.  The horns and hooves are black.  Satyrs living near centaurs are
likely to be friendly with them.
~
-1 TITAN TITANS~

Titans are gargantuan, almost godlike men and women.  They, quite simply,
look like 25 foot tall people of great physical strength and beauty.  They
are commonly dressed in traditional Greek garb, favoring togas, loincloths,
and such.  They wear rare and valuable jewelry and in other ways make
themselves seem beautiful and overpowering.  Titans are very close to nature.
~
-1 WANDS STAVES SCROLLS~

agical items require training to use properly.  If your character lacks the
necessary skill to use an item, he will fail, possibly destroying it.  The
item skills are as follows:

scrolls		The reading of magical scrolls and books (see 'help recite')
staves		The use of staves and similar devices (see 'help brandish')
wands		The use of wands and similar items (see 'help zap') 
~
-1 'GROUP HEADER'~

The following skills and groups are available to your character:
(this list may be seen again by typing list)
~
-1 'GROUP HELP'~

The following commands are available:
list         display all groups and skills not yet bought
learned      show all groups and skills bought 
premise      brief explanation of creation points and skill groups
add <name>   buy a skill or group

~
-1 'MENU CHOICE'~

Choice (add,drop,list,help)?~
-1 'GROUPS' 'INFO' 'PREMISE'~

The ROT skill system allows you to fully customize your new character, making
him or her skilled in the skills you choose.  But beware, the skills you pick
at character creation are the only skills you will ever learn.  Skills are 
paid for with creation points, and the more creation points you have, the
harder it is to gain a level.  Furthermore, higher-cost skills are harder to
practice.

Skill groups are like package deals for characters -- sets of skills or spells
that are closely related, and hence can be learned as a unit.  There is a 
default skill group for each class, which can be selected for a balanced 
selection of skills at a somewhat reduced cost.

The experience breakdown is as follows: 
points   exp/level     points   exp/level
40        1000         90        6000
50        1500         100       8000
60	  2000         110      12000
70        3000         120      16000 
80        4000         130      24000
The table continues in a similar manner for higher point totals.
~
-1 'CLASS'~

Syntax:  class
         class {{name} all
	 class {{name} skill
         class {{name} <group>

Typing class by itself will list all spell groups that you currently have.
The [class all] format will list all groups that are available to your
particular class.  The [class skill] method will list all skills available
to your class, along with the level at which you receive the skill.
The [class <group>] method will list all of the spells available to your
class within that group, along with the level at which you receive the spell.
The {{name} field is optional, and will allow you to view the groups,
skills, & spells that other classes receive.
Example:
     class gladiator skill
This will show you all the skills that a gladiator receives, and the levels
at which they may use them.
~
-1 BASICS 'ROT BASICS'~

wands		use of magical wands

for class defaults, check the classes themselves.
~
-1 MAGE 'MAGIC-USER' 'MAGE BASICS' 'MAGE DEFAULT'~

ages specialize in the casting of spells, offensive ones in particular.
ages have the highest-powered magic of any class, and are the only classes
able to use the draconian and enchanting spell groups.  They are also very
skilled at the use of magical items, though their combat skills are the 
weakest of any class.

All mages have the power to levitate a shield in front of them, freeing
both hands for weapons.

transporation	spells for getting from here to there

~
-1 CLERIC 'CLERIC BASICS' 'CLERIC DEFAULT'~

Clerics are the most defensively orientated of all the classes.  Most of their
spells focus on healing or defending the faithful, with their few combat spells
being far less powerful than those of mages. However, clerics are the best 
class by far at healing magics, and they posess an impressive area of
protective magics, as well as fair combat prowess.

Clerics receive the power to levitate a shield in front of them once they
reach level 50, freeing both hands for weapons.

All clerics begin with skill in the mace.  Other weapon or shield skills must
be purchased, many at a very dear cost.  The default skill selection for

weather         spells for conjuring and mastering the elements
~
-1 THIEF 'THIEF BASICS' 'THIEF DEFAULT'~

Thieves are a marginal class. They do few things better than any other class,
but have the widest range of skills available.  Thieves are specialists at
thievery and covert actions, being capable of entering areas undetected where
more powerful adventurers would fear to tread.  They are better fighters than
clerics, but lack the wide weapon selection of warriors.

All thieves begin with the dagger combat skill, and are learned in steal as 
well.  Any other weapon skills must be purchased, unless the default selection
is chosen.  This default skill package includes:

skills:
mace		the use of maces and other blunt weapons
sword		swordplay and fencing

~
-1 WARRIOR 'WARRIOR BASICS' 'WARRIOR DEFAULT'~

Warriors live for combat and the thrill of battle. They are the best fighters
of all the classes, but lack the subtle skills of thieves and the magical
talents of mages and priests.  Warriors are best for those who don't mind
taking the direct approach, even when another method might be called for.

Warriors begin with skill in the sword, and gain a second attack in combat.
Other weapon skills may be purchased cheaply, or gained in the default skill
package, which includes the following:

third attack	allows the skilled warrior to land three blows in one round
~
-1 RANGER 'RANGER BASICS' 'RANGER DEFAULT'~

Rangers are travelling warrior-druids, usually solitary and aloof.  They
are often the protectors of those far from home, travellers who are lost,
or even bounty hunters who track criminals in order to bring them to
justice or just to make a buck.  They are sometimes used as scouts for
armies, and sometimes make up their own force in times of war.

Rangers don't have the pure combat effectiveness of warriors, and lack
the total control of druidic magic that druids possess, but the combination
of those disciplines makes them a class to be reckoned with.

skills:
backstab        the art of hitting your opponent by surprise
enhanced damage this skill multiplies your damage in battle
parry           the art of parrying with weapons
shield block    the art of parrying with a shield
weaponsmaster   this group provides knowledge of all weapon types

spell groups:
curative        spells that cure the sick and feeble of their ailments
healing         spells for treating wounds, from scratches to death blows
transportation  spells for getting from here to there
weather         spells for conjuring and mastering the elements
~
-1 DRUID 'DRUID BASICS' 'DRUID DEFAULT'~

Druids are the protectors of nature.  Some spend their lives in forests,
others in deserts, and some still in seas or mountainous regions.  Where
a druid can be closer to nature and life than to the constructs of mortals,
that druid can be happy.

They control a very powerful blend of magic, potent healing spells with
devastating combat spells, but they don't have transportation spells, as
druids are not wont to travel.  They aren't always well suited for it.

skills:
lore            the lore of magical items
second attack   with training, the skilled druid can hit twice as fast
shield block    the art of parrying with a shield
sneak           with this skill, a druid can walk into a room undetected

spell groups:
attack          a selection of offensive magics
benedictions    powerful magics that grant the blessings of the gods
creation        the making of physical objects, such as food and water
curative        spells that cure the sick and feeble of their ailments
healing         spells for treating wounds, from scratches to death blows
protective      defensive magics, including the powerful sanctuary spell
weather         spells for conjuring and mastering the elements
~
-1 VAMPIRE 'VAMPIRE BASICS' 'VAMPIRE DEFAULT'~

Vampires are killers.  They aren't truly alive in the sense that most
mortals are, but are rather undead, not really subject to whithering of
old age or the fading of the mind that those who are truly alive find
themselves subject to.  As a result vampires are long lived, and almost
all of them eventually go insane.  They are very much like thieves, but
possess very potent powers of magic.

Vampires are not really a class in the traditional since, as many don't
choose to be what they are, and their powers are not the result of education
and training, but of undead nature.

skills:
backstab        the art of hitting your opponent by surprise
disarm          used to deprive your opponent of his weapon
dodge           the best way to take a punch is not to be there
shield block    the art of parrying with a shield
sneak           with this skill, a vampire can walk into a room undetected

spell groups:
beguiling       spells that control the mind
detection       informational magics, such as detect magic and identify
enhancement     spells that maximize physical potential, such as haste
illusion        magics for concealing and deceiving
maladictions    a selection of curses fit for any witch
transportation  spells for getting from here to there
~
-1 WIZARD 'WIZARD BASICS' 'WIZARD DEFAULT'~

Wizards are the highest level mage and like their weaker counter parts
they specialize in the casting of spells, offensive ones in particular.
Again, like the weaker mages, wizards have the highest powered magic of
any class.  They are also very skilled at the useage of magical items,
though their combat skills are something to be desired.
 
All wizards have the power to levitate a shield in front of them, freeing
both hands for weapons.  Again like the mage all wizards begin with skill
in dagger.  Any other weapon skills must be purchased; at an extremly
high rate.
 
The default skill selection for wizards is as follows:
 
skills:
  Lore
 
spell groups:
  Beguiling
  Combat
  Detection
  Enhancement
  Illusion
  Maladictions
  Protective
  Transportation
  Weather
  Shielding
~
-1 PRIEST 'PRIEST BASICS' 'PRIEST DEFAULT'~

Priests are the most defensively oriented of all the classes.  Most of
their spells focus on healing or defending the faithful, with their few co
bats spells being far less powerful but just as effective as those of
wizards.  However, priests are the best class at healing magics, and they
possess an impressive area of protective magics, as well as fair combat
prowess.
 
Priests receive the power to levitate a shield in front of them, thus
freeing both hands for weapons.  All priests begin with skill in mace or
flail.  Other weapon or shielding skills must be purchased, many at a very
dear cost.  Unless the default package is selected.  This package
includes:
 
Skills:
  Mace
  Flail
  Shield block

  Creation
  Maladictions
  Benedictions
  Curative
  Transportation
  Protective
  Attack
  Detection
  Weather
  healing
  Enchantment
~
-1 MERCENARY 'MERCENARY BASICS' 'MERCENARY DEFAULT'~

ercenaries, like thieves, are a marginal class.  They do few things
better than other classes, but have the widest range of skills available.
They are specialists ath thievery and covert actions, being capable of
entering areas undetected where more powerful adventurers would fear to
tread.  Because of this they are usually hired as spies and assassins,
with their loyalties lying with the highest bidder.
 
They are better fighters than clerics, but lack the wide weapon selection
of warriors.  All mercenaries begin with dagger and are learned in steal
as well.  Any other weapon skills must be purchased, unless the default
selection is chosen.  The default package includes:
 
Skills:
  Sword
  backstab
  disarm
  dodge
  second attack

~
-1 GLADIATOR 'GLADIATOR BASICS' 'GLADIATOR DEFAULT'~

Gladiators live for combat, the thrill of battle, and lust for the taste
fo victory.  They are the best fighters of all the classes, but lack the
subtle skill of mercenaries and the magical talents of wizards.
Gladiators are best for those who don't mind the direct approach, in fact,
for a gladiator there is no other.
 
Gladiators begin with skill in sword, and gain a second attack in battle.
Other weapon skills may be purchased at an extremly cheap rate, or gained
through the default package which includes:
 
Skills:
  Weaponmaster
  Shield block
  Bash
  Enhanced damage
  Parry
  Rescue

  Fourth attack
  Dual wield
~
-1 STRIDER 'STRIDER BASICS' 'STRIDER DEFAULT'~

Striders are travelling warrior-druids, usually solitary and aloaf.  They
are often the protectors of those far from home, travellers who are lost,
or even bounty hunters who track criminals in order to bring them to
justice and to make a buck.  They are sunetimes used as scounts for
armies, and sometimes make up their own force in times of war.  Striders
dont have the pure combat effectiveness of warriors, and lack the total
control of druidic magic that a druid possesses, but the combination of
those disciplines make them a class to be reckoned with.
 
Like priests, all striders have the power to levitate a shield in front of
them, freeing both hands for weapons.  All striders begin with skill in
dagger, tracking, and gain a second attack in battle.. The skill default
for striders is as follows:
 
Skills:
  Weaponmaster
  Enhanced damage
  Backstab
  Parry
  Shield block

Sages are the protectors of nature.  Some spend their lives in forests,
others in deserts, and some still in seas or mountainsous regions.
Anywhere a sage can be closer to nature and away from the constructs of
mortals, that Sage can be happy.
 
They, like the druid, control a very powerful blend of magic.  Including
but not limited to potent healing spells accompainied by devasting combat
spells.  Sages dont have transportation spells, as a sage is not wont to
travel.  The Default skill list is as follows:

  Benedictions

~
-1 LICH 'LICH BASICS' 'LICH DEFAULT'~

Liches, like vampires, are brutal Killers.  They arent truly alive in the
sense that most mortals are, but are rather undead.  Because of this they
are not subject to the withering of old age or the fading of the mind that
those owho are truly alive find themselves subject to.  Liches are
extemely long lived and are thought to have brung the extinction of
the Titans as well as other races.  They are very much like mercenaries,
but possess very potent powers of magic.
 
However, unlike vampires, liches are a class.  They are the makers of all
vampires and in turn are the bringers of death to all the other classes of
Realm.  Those who have come upon one of these beings is never ever truly
the same again.  The default skill selection is as follows:
 
Skill:
  Dagger
  Dodge
  Hide

~
-1 EXOTIC WEAPONS WEAPON WEAPONSMASTER AXE DAGGER FLAIL MACE POLEARM SPEAR SWORD WHIP~

Each weapon skill applies to a specific group of armaments, and determines how
well a character fights with a particular weapon.  The weaponsmaster group
provides talent in all weapons (save exotics), from chair legs to halberds.
If the character has the parry skill as well, he can parry incoming attacks.
The chance of parrying is best if the character in question is skilled at 
both his weapon and his opponent's.

The weapon skills consist of the following:

weaponsmaster	skill group of all weapons listed below (save exotic weaponry)
axe		the use of axes, ranging from hand to great (but not halberds)
dagger		the use of knives and daggers, and other stabbing weapons
flail		skill in ball-and-chain type weapons
mace		this skill includes clubs and hammers as well as maces
polearm		the use of pole weapons (except spears), including halberds
spear		this skill covers both spears and staves, but not polearms
sword		the warrior's standby, from rapier to claymore
whip		the use of whips, chains, and bullwhips
exotic		the use of strange magical weapons

The exotic skill cannot be purchased, and is dependent solely upon level.
~
-1 TRANSPORT~

Syntax: cast transport <object> <char>

This spell will transport an obj from your inventory to the inventory of
another player.  You can turn off the ability to receive transports using
the notran command.
~
-1 'SHIELD BLOCK'~

Shield block is a rather fancy name for the art of parrying with a shield.
Characters with no shield block skill will not be able to defend themselves
well with a shield.  All classes may learn shield block, but only warriors and
clerics are good at it.  Beware, flails ignore shield blocking attempts, and
whips have an easier time getting around them.  Axes may split shields in two.
~
-1 ATTACK~

The attack spells are essentially powerful curses, fueled by divine energy
rather than magical power (like the combat spells are). They are less powerful
than the combat spells, but can still deal out a stinging blow.  Mages and

These sorcerous spells are, in the words of one famous mage, just 'more ways to
toss energy around'.  They are the most powerful of the damaging spells, and

contains the following magics:

bringing forth the devastating power of their breath weapons upon your foes.

of them ever reach the level of mastery required to use them.

fire breath	 calls forth the flames of a red dragon
frost breath	 drains the life from a foe with the power a white dragon
gas breath	 suffocates your enemies with poison gas

although more will be added in the future.  Only mages may enchant.

enchant weapon	increases the hit and damage bonuses of a weapon
enchant armor	increases the protective value of armor
fireproof       shields items from the harmful effects of fire and acid
recharge	restores power to a depleted wand or staff
~
-1 ENHANCEMENT~

The enhancement spells improve upon the body's potential, allowing feats of
superhuman strength and speed.  However, these spells may often have harmful
effects upon the recipient.

giant strength	grants increased strength
haste		doubles the speed of the target, but slows down healing
infravision	allows monsters to be seen in the dark
refresh		restores energy to tired adventurers
~
-1 HARMFUL~

This spell group is the opposite of healing.  The harmful spells are designed
to tear flesh from bone, rupture arteries, and generally turn the body against
itself.  Only priests and warriors may use this spell group.
In order of power, the harmful spells are:

cause light	inflicts minor wounds on an enemy
cause serious	inflicts wounds on a foe
cause critical  causes major damage to the target
harm		the most deadly harmful spell
~
-1 HEALING~

The healing spells are used to cure the wounds that adventurers inevitably
suffer in battle.  For curing other conditions, such as poison, see the
curative spell group.  Only warriors and priests have access to this group.
In order of power, the healing spells are:

cure light	heals minor wounds
refresh		restores vigor to a tired adventurer
cure serious	heals wounds
cure critical	closes all but the worst wounds
heal		the most powerful healing spell
mass healing	casts a heal spell on each player in the room
~
-1 ILLUSION~

The illusions spells are dedicated to deception and trickery.  They can be
used to mask appearances, or create distractions for the party.  Currently,
the illusion group is very small, but it will be expanded in the future.
Only thieves and mages can cast illusion spells, which consist of the 
following:

invis		turns the target invisible
mass invis	turns the caster's group invisible
ventriloquate	allows the caster to put words in someone's mouth
~
-1 MALADICTIONS~

aladictions are a group of curses and other baneful spells, designed to
cripple, inconvenience, or torture, rather than kill outright.  These spells
may be cast by any class.

blindess	strikes the target blind
curse		prevents recalling and weakens the target in combat
energy drain	drains experience and mana, while strengthening the caster
plague		causes the target to suffer a slow, painful death from plague
poison		weaker than plague, but often fatal
slow		slows your enemies down, reducing their rate of attack	
weaken		drains the strength of the target
~
-1 PROTECTIVE~

The protective spells are used to shield against harm, whether from spells or
physical attack.  They range from the weak armor spell to the sought-after
sanctuary charm.  Also included in this group are several spells for dispeling
hostile magics. Any class may use this group, which consists of the following 
spells:

armor		provides the target with an extra layer of defense
cancellation	a powerful dispel, used for removing spells from friends

~
-1 SHIELDING FIRESHIELD ICESHIELD SHOCKSHIELD~

These arcane and costly spells are only for the most learned of the ranks of
mages and clerics wandering the land.  They require great amounts of energy
and can be very devastating.  The following spells are included in this
group and are listed in order of strength:

        iceshield       surrounds target with a thick shell of ice
        fireshield      surrounds target with a flaming inferno
        shockshield     surrounds target with a crackling sphere

These spells were coded by Kelson (Micah Bartell) for use with ROM based muds,
and are released under the GNU license.(use them, edit them, give me mention)
Questions and comments can be sent to micah@cse.unl.edu.
~
-1 TRANSPORTATION~

The transportation group is used for travel, whether by flight, magical
teleportation, or walking through walls.  All classes may learn these spells,
which are among the most useful in the game.

fly		allows the target to fly over nearly all obstacles
gate		transports the caster to the target
nexus		forms a two-way portal to a far off destination

portal		creates a one-way portal to a destination

teleport	sends the target to a random location
transport	sends the target object to another player
word of recall	transports the caster to safety in Midgaard
~
-1 WEATHER~

These spells allow the caster to manipulate local weather conditions, as well
as summon fog clouds, lightning, or even electrical glows.  This group is
usable by all classes.

call lightning	summons a huge bolt from the heavens, if the weather is right
control weather	changes the weather in the manner desired by the caster
faerie fire	surrounds the target in a glowing aura
faerie fog	reveals all hidden creatures in the room
lightning bolt	sends a bolt of electricity into the target

(the weather command, unrelated to this group, shows local weather conditions)
~
-1 BACKSTAB~

Backstab is the favored attack of  thieves, murderers, and other rogues.  It 
can be used with any weapon type, but is most effective with piercing weapons.
The damage inflicted by a backstab is determined by the attacker's level, his
weapon skill, his backstab skill, and the power of his opponent.
Only thieves may learn the backstab.
~
-1 BASH~

The bash skill is a warrior talent, a brute-force attack designed to knock
your foe to his knees.  Its success depends on many factors, including the
bash rating, your weight, and the size of your opponent.  Bashing a dragon
is not generally a wise idea.
~
-1 BERSERK~

Only powerful warriors can master berserking, the ability to enter insane rage
in combat.  Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy spell -- a huge
surge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for personal safety.  
Berserking warriors are more resistant to the effects of magic.
~
-1 DIRT 'DIRT KICKING'~

Consider by some to be a cowardly skill, dirt kicking gives the clever 
combatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt into his eyes.  The
blindness does not last long, but can provide an edge in combat.  Dexterity
helps in hitting or avoiding a dirt kick.  Only warriors and thieves may
learn this skill.
~
-1 DISARM~

Disarm is a somewhat showy and unreliable skill, designed to relieve your
opponent of his weapon.  The best possible chance of disarming occurs when you
are skilled both your own and your opponent's weapon. Only talented thieves
and warriors may learn this skill.
~
-1 DODGE~

In the words of one wise warrior, 'the best way to block a blow is to not
be where it lands'.  The dodge skill honors this tradition, by improving the
character's natural agility to the point where many blows will miss the 
target. The chance of dodging is also affected by the dexterity of the
attacker and the target.  Any class may learn dodging.
~
-1 'ENHANCED DAMAGE'~

Warriors and skilled thieves can become skilled enough in combat that they are
able to inflict more damage than other classes.  Enhanced damage is checked
for with each hit, although with a low skill, the chance of receiving a bonus
is very low indeed.
~
-1 ENVENOM~

The envenom skill is a cowardly skill practiced only by thieves, designed to
win a battle through alchemy and treachery rather than skill or strength.
Or, put another way, it's a skill used by the smart to kill the foolish.
Food, drink, and weapons may be envenomed, with varying effects. Poisoned
food or drink puts a mild poison spell on the consumer, and is unlikely to
be more than a minor inconvience (after all, the typical adventurer could
drink sewer water with only a trace of the runs).  A poisoned weapon, on
the other hand, can inflict serious damage on an opponent as the poison 
burns through his bloodstream.  But be careful, blade venom evaporates 
quickly and is rendered almost powerless by repeated blows in combat.
~
-1 'HAND TO HAND'~

Hand to hand combat is a rare skill in the lands of Midgaard.  Learning this
stance of fighting gives the player a weapon even when disarmed -- bare hands.
Trained hand to hand experts are far more effective than many swordsmen.
Clerics and warriors are the best at this skill, although thieves and mages
may also learn it.
~
-1 KICK~

Kicking allows the adventurer to receive an extra attack in combat, a powerful
kick. However, a failed kick may throw an unwary fighter off balance.  Fighters
and clerics are the most skilled at kicking, although thieves may also learn
it.
~
-1 PARRY~

If at first you fail to dodge, block it.  Parry is useful for deflecting 
attacks, and is succesful more often than dodge.  Parry requires a weapon for
full success, the hand-to-hand skill may also be used, but results in reduced
damage instead of no damage.  The best chance of parrying occurs when the
defender is skilled in both his and his opponent's weapon type.
~
-1 RESCUE~

A friend in need is a friend indeed.  And when in combat, a warrior with
the rescue skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue allows you to intercede
in combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily harm. Hopefully the
favor will be returned.  Success in rescuing depends on the skill rating, as
well as a comparision of level, dexterity, and speed between the character and
the target. (note: you rescue a friend, not the monster)
~
-1 TRIP~

Back by popular demand.  Trip is a somewhat dastardly attack, and involves
using any one of a number of methods to bring your opponent down to the ground.
Tripping large monsters is generally not a good idea, and agile ones will
find the attack easy to avoid.  Thieves and warriors may learn trip.
~
-1 'SECOND ATTACK'~

Training in second attack allows the character a chance at additional strikes
in combat -- allow a 100% second attack does NOT guarantee 2 attacks every
round.  Any class may learn this skill, although clerics and mages have a 
very hard time with it.
~
-1 'THIRD ATTACK'~

Training in third attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike
in a combat, and increases the chance of a second attack as well.  Perfect
third attack does NOT assure three attacks per round.  Only warriors, rangers,
and highly skilled thieves may learn this skill.
~
-1 'FOURTH ATTACK'~

Training in fourth attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike
in a combat, and increases the chance of a third attack as well.  Perfect
fourth attack does NOT assure four attacks per round.  Only warriors, rangers,
and highly skilled thieves may learn this skill.
~
-1 'FIFTH ATTACK'~

Training in fifth attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike
in a combat, and increases the chance of a fourth attack as well.  Perfect
fifth attack does NOT assure five attacks per round.  Only warriors and highly
skilled rangers may learn this skill.
~
-1 HIDE SNEAK~

Hide and sneak are similar skills, both related to remaining undetected.
Hide has a very high chance of success, but only works for as long as the
character remains stationary.  Sneak may be used when moving (including to
sneak by monsters), but has a lower chance of success.  Only warriors and
thieves may learn these skills.
~
-1 'FAST HEALING'~

The fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking, resting,
or sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just general 
toughness and stamina.  Fast healing is checked every tick, and it is 
possible for it to fail.  All class may learn this skill, but mages find it
very difficult to master, due to their bookish lifestance.
~
-1 LORE~

Lore is a general skill, consisting of knowledge of myths and legends. Use
of the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an object,
concerning its power and uses.
All but the warrior and undead classes may learn lore.
~
-1 HAGGLE HAGGLING~

Haggling is an indispensable skill to the trader.  It allows a character to
match wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for merchandise,
or to buy at the lowest possible cost.  Unfortunately, most merchants are 
already very skilled at haggling, so the untrainined adventurer had best 
guard his treasure closely.  Thieves are natural masters at haggling, 
although other classes may learn it as well.
~
-1 PEEK~

Peek is both a skill and a command.

The peek skill is useful for seeing what a player or monster is carrying,
the better to use the steal command with.

Syntax: peek <char>
This will attempt to peek at a characters inventory, you may also make
this automatic during a: look <char>  by turning on AUTOPEEK.
~
-1 STUN~

This works in combination with bash.  For every successful bash, you have a
1 in 5 (based on 100% skill level) chance of stunning your opponent.
A stunned opponent will not be able to fight back in any way for either one
or two rounds of the fight (1 in 5 chance of it being 2 rounds based on 100%
skill level also.)
~
-1 GRIP~

The grip skill makes a character much more resistant to being disarmed.
~
-1 GOUGE~

Gouging is a skill whereby thieves can temporarily blind an enemy by gouging
at thier eyes.
~
-1 TRACK~

Allows you to track a person or mobile.  Only the last 20 moves a character
makes are stored.  This can be defeated in a number of ways: By moving fast
(because of only 20 moves being saved), by recalling/gating/etc.., by going
through an alignment-sensitive exit (if the tracker is the opposite aligned),
by flying (since you won't leave tracks), and by being invisible (if the
tracker does not have detect_invisible)
~
-1 FEED~

This allows you to feed on your opponent during a fight, taking
some of thier hp and adding it to your own (up to your max_hp).
~
-1 CIRCLE~

This allows you to circle behind an opponent during a fight, simulating a
backstab.
~
-1 'DUAL WIELD'~

EVERYONE can wield a second weapon, this skill affects how good you are with
any weapon held in your off hand.  Everyone starts out with a 33%, but those
with this skill can increase the odds of the second weapon being used. for
example, a person without this skill, or one who's skill is at 0% will only
have a 1 in 3 chance of hitting with the second weapon per round in a fight.
(even if you hit with the second weapon, you could still do 0 damage and be
told you missed).  The dual wield skill fills in the other 2/3 chance, so
someone with 100% in dual wield will use the second weapon in almost every
round in a fight.
~
-1 PICK 'PICK LOCK'~

Lock picking is one of the prime skills of thieves, allowing them to gain
access to many secured areas.  Lock picking chances are improved by  
intelligence, and hindered by the difficulty of the lock. Other classes may
learn to pick locks, but they will never find it easy.
~
-1 MEDITATION~

This skill is similar to fast healing, but relies on the concentration and
mantras to increase mana recovery when the character is sleeping or resting.
Thieves and warriors, with their troubled minds and violent attitudes, have
much trouble learning to meditate.
~
-1 STEAL~

Theft is the defining skill of the thief, and is only available to that class.
It allows items to be stolen from the inventory of monsters and characters,
and even from shops!  But beware, shop keepers gaurd their merchandise 
carefully, and attempting to steal from a character earns you a THIEF flag
if you are caught (making you free game for killing).
~
-1 'DETECT GOOD'~

Syntax: cast 'detect good'
 
This spell enables the caster to detect good characters, which will
reveal a characteristic golden aura.
~
-1 'DISPEL GOOD'~

Syntax: cast 'dispel good' <victim>
 
This spell invokes the wrath of Belan on a good victim. It can be very
dangerous for casters who are pure of heart.
~
-1 'RECHARGE'~

Syntax: cast 'recharge' <item>

The recharge spell is used to restore energy to depleted wands and staves.
Fully exhausted items cannot be recharged, and the difficulty of the spell
is proportional to the number of charges used.  Magic items can only be
recharged one time successfully.
~
-1 'DEMONFIRE'~

Syntax: cast 'demonfire' <target>

Demonfire is a spell of blackest evil, and as such can only be used by those
who follow the paths of darkness.  It conjures forth demonic spirits to 
inflict terrible wounds on the enemies of the caster.
~
-1 'RAY OF TRUTH'~

Syntax: cast 'ray of truth' <target>

Ray of truth opens a portal to the planes of positive energy, bringing forth
a beam of light of sufficient purity to harm or or annihilate the servants
of evil.  It cannot harm the pure of heart, and will turn and strike 
casters who are tainted by evil.
~
-1 'PORTAL'~

Syntax: cast 'portal' <target>

The portal spell is similar to gate, but creates a lasting one-way portal
to the target creature, instead of transporting the caster.  Portals are
entered using 'enter' or 'go' command, as in 'go portal'.  Portals cannot
be made to certain destinations, nor used to escape from gate-proof rooms.
Portal requires a special source of power to be used, unfortunately the
secret of this material component has been lost...
~
-1 'NEXUS'~

Syntax: cast 'nexus' <target>

This spell is virtually identical to portal (see 'help portal'), with the
only difference being that while portal creates a one-way gate, a nexus 
spell makes a two-sided gate.  It also lasts longer than the lower-powered
portal spell.  Both spells require an additional power source, the secret
of which has been lost...
~
-1 'HEAT METAL'~

Syntax: cast 'heat metal' <target>

Heat metal is a powerful clerical attack spell, with effects that vary 
according to the armor of the victim.  It heats up the metal equipment
(assumed to be all weapons and armor at this point in time) on the target,
causing him or her to drop them if possible, taking serious burns in the
process (possibly fatal if the equipment is too heavy to remove easily).
This spell does no damage to creatures who are immune to fire.
~
-1 'HOLY WORD'~

Syntax: cast 'holy word'

Holy word involves the invocation of the full power of a cleric's god, with
disasterous effects upon the enemies of the priest coupled with powerful
blessings on the priest's allies.  All creatures of like alignment in the
room are blessed and filled with righteous divine wrath, while those of
opposite morals (or both good and evil in the case of neutral priests)
are struck down by holy (or unholy might) and cursed.  The cleric suffers
greatly from the strain of this spell, being left unable to move and 
drained of vitality.  Experience loss is no longer associated with the spell.
~
-1 FRENZY~

Syntax: cast 'frenzy' <target>

The frenzy spell fills the target with righteous fury, greatly increasing
his or her attack skill and damaging capacity.  Unfortunately, this divine
wrath is coupled with a tendency to ignore threats to personal safety, 
making the character easier to hit.  Frenzy provides immunity to the calm
spell (see 'help calm'), and may only be used on those of the caster's 
alignment.
~
-1 CALM~

Syntax: cast 'calm' 

One of the most useful and often overlooked abilities of the master cleric is
the calm spell, which can put an end to all violence in a room.  Calmed
creatures will not attack of their own volition, and are at a disadvantage
in combat as long as the spell soothes their minds.  The more violence 
activity there is in a room, the harder the spell, and it is all or nothing --
either all combat in the room is ended (with the exception of those who
are immune to magic) or none is.
~
-1 HASTE~

Syntax: cast 'haste' <target>

The haste spell increases the speed and agility of the recipient, allowing
an extra attack (or even a backstab) in combat, and improving evasive
abilities in combat.  However, it produces a great strain on the system,
such that recuperative abilities are halved.  Haste is capable of negating
the slow spell. (see 'help slow').
~
-1 SLOW~

Syntax: cast 'slow' <target>

Despite popular mythology, slow is not the opposite of haste, but is a spell
with it's own unique set of effects.  When cast on an unfortunate victim,
it slows its movements, making it easier to hit and reducing its rate
of attack.  The effect of slow also double movement costs and halve healing
rates, due to reduced metabolism.
~
-1 PLAGUE~

Syntax: cast 'plague' <target>

The plague spell infests the target with a magical disease of great virulence,
sapping its strength and causing horrific suffering, possibly leading to
death.  It is a risky spell to use, as the contagion can spread like
wildfire if the victim makes it to a populated area.
~
-1 'CREATE ROSE'~

Syntax: cast 'create rose'

A romantic spell that creates a fragrant red rose, with utterly no game
use whatsoever.
~
-1 'PROTECTION GOOD' 'PROTECTION EVIL'~

Syntax: cast 'protection evil' <target>
	cast 'protection good' <target>

The protection spells reduce damage taken from attackers of the appropriate
ethos, and improve saving throws against all forms of magic. They may not
be cast on others, and one person cannot carry both defenses at the same
time.
~
0 'GIANT STRENGTH'~

Syntax: cast 'giant strength' <character>
 
This spell increases the strength of the target character.
~
-1 'CHAIN LIGHTNING'~

Syntax : cast 'chain lightning' <target>

Chain lightning is a deadly spell, producing a powerful bolt of lightning
that arcs from target to target in the room, until its force is fully
expended.  Allies of the caster may be hit by this spell if they are members 
of a clan, while the caster himself will not be struck unless no other
viable target remains.  Chain lightning is most effective when used on
groups of creatures.
~
-1 SCAN FARSIGHT~

scan farsight
Syntax: scan
	scan <direction>
	cast 'farsight'

The scan command allows the user to detect movement in surrounding areas.

The farsight spell expands the caster's consciousness, allowing him or her
to see far away beings like they were in the same room.  It takes intense
concentration, often leaving the caster helpless for several minutes.
The spell may be used for a general scan that reaches a short distance in
all directions, or with a directional component to see creatures much
farther away.
~
-1 MASS HEALING~

Syntax: cast 'mass healing' 

The mass healing spell, as its name might suggest, performs a healing spell
on all players in the room.  It also throws in a refresh spell for good
measure.
~
-1 'FLOATING DISC'~

Syntax: cast 'floating disc'

This useful spell creates a floating field of force which follows the caster
around, allowing him or her to pile treasure high with no fear of weight
penalties.  It lasts no more than twice the casters level in hours, and
usually less.  It can hold 10 pounds per level of the caster, with a 
maximum of five pounds per item.  The spell requires an open float location
on the character, and the only way to remove the disc is to die or allow it
to run out of energy.
~
-1 FIREPROOF~

Syntax: cast 'fireproof' <object>

The fireproof spell creates a short-lived protective aura around an object,
to protect it from the harmful effects of acid and flame.  Items protected
by this spell are not harmed by acid, fire, or the heat metal spell.
Although inexpensive to use, the spell's short duration makes it impractical
for protecting large numbers of objects.
~
-1 ALIAS UNALIAS~

Syntax: alias
	alias <word>
	alias <word> <substitution>
	unalias <word>

The alias command allows limited shortening of command names.  At this time,
aliases cannot call other aliases, and cannot generate more than one command.
Alias by itself lists your current aliases, Alias <word> lists the alias with 
that name (if such exist), and alias with both a word and and argument 
produces a new alias.  You cannot alias either alias or unalias to a new
command.  Examples of use:

alias gc get all corpse --> typing gc will equal typing 'get all corpse'
alias ff cast 'fireball' --> ff orc will equal 'cast 'fireball' orc'

Only the first word on the line will be subsituted at this time.
~
-1 NOCANCEL NOFOLLOW NOLOOT NOSUMMON NOTRAN~

Similar in function to the auto commands, all of these commands are toggles
that turn on or off their function.
 
nocancel  :  turns on or off immunity to cancellation
nofollow  :  turns on or off ability to accept followers
noloot      :  prevents corpse from being looted when on
nosummon:  prevents summoning when toggled on
notran      :  when toggled on makes you immune to transport
 
You start by not being immune to cancellation and transport,  safe from
looting, you will accept followers,  and  cannot be summoned.  Type the
command once to change, typing it again will toggle it back.
The status of noloot, nosummon, nofollow can be seen by  typing autolist.
(see also help auto)
~
-1 OLC EDIT~

Syntax: EDIT AREA [create/reset] [vnum]		- Area Creation and Repoping.
Syntax: EDIT ROOM ( [create] [vnum] )		- Room Creation and Editing.
Syntax: EDIT OBJ  [create] <vnum>		- Object Creation and Editing.
Syntax: EDIT MOB  [create] <vnum>		- Mobile Creation and Editing.
Syntax: EDIT MP   [create] <vnum>               - MobProg Creation/Editing.

Syntax: ASAVE  <world/area/changed/list>	- Save Editing to Disk.
Syntax: ALIST                                   - Listing of Areas.
Syntax: RESET  See Help Resets.			- Set Game Resets.

Definition: [optional]  <required>  (combined arguments)

     The above commands are used to expand the game world.  The original
code is based on was written by Surreality and installed in The Isles by Locke.
It was then converted to work with Envy by Jason Dinkel, and ported to ROM
2.3 by Hans Birkeland (Hugin). Port to Rom 2.4 by Ivan Toledo (ver 1.7).

     Inside an editor, typing COMMANDS lists working commands and ? gives
help. AEDIT and REDIT default to the current area or room. EDIT ROOM RESET
resets the current room.  Most commands with no arguments display syntax.

~
0 HITDICE~

A high number of dice makes for less variance in mobiles hitpoints.
Suggested values are:

       level:     dice         min         max        mean
         1:       1d2+6       7(  7)     8(   8)     8(   8)

	50:    10d169+920   930(923)  2610(2610)  1770(1767)

Diff = max - min.  Mean is the arithmetic mean.
The values in parenthesis are the the standard merc values.
~
0 MANADICE~

A high number of dice makes for less variance in mobiles mana.
The values the server generates for merc-type mobs is

  <level> d 10 + 100

where level is the level of the mobile.
~
0 DAMDICE~

A high number of dice makes for less variance in mobiles hitpoints.
Suggested values are:

       Level      dice       min      min    mean
        1         1d2+0       1        2       2

       50         5d10+25    30       75      53

ean is the arithmetic mean.  The values in parenthesis are the the
standard merc values.  (Will be put in when there's time to calculate
them...)
~
0 RESETS~

Syntax: RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> <location on body>    - equips last mobile
        RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> inside <obj vnum>     - store in container
        RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> room                  - store in room
        RESET <number> MOB <vnum> [<max #>]             - load a mobile
        RESET <number> DELETE                           - delete a reset

RESET alone will display the resets in the current room.  The <number> will
be displayed with this list.  Typing ? WEAR-LOC will list possible locations
that an object can be loaded to.  The [<max #>] is the maximum number of
mobiles allowed in this room and will default to 1 if no number is entered.

For resets to be successful make sure that you add them in a logical order.
For example if you are equiping a mobile don't load a container in the room
and fill it with some objects and then continue equiping the mobile.  It is
likely that resets will backfire if they are not carefully entered.

If you wish to reset the room then use EDIT ROOM RESET.

    80        -400     -400     -400    -150

These values are 10 times what you would put in an area file. This
is because the server multiplies what it reads from file with 10.
