nudged him and he broke out of his block. With Rainman
doing the main debugging and alot of dark beer, this
area was created for your amusement. The secret to sailing
is that all simple seas never border on grounding reefs.
If you are in shallows type exit after each move to look 
for shoals ( they wont show in the night ). There is a main
clockwise current running in the high seas, so don't sleep
on the high seas, or you will drift.. There are alot of 
clues throughout isles so don't just powermud and miss all.
Lok charmed me so you wouldn't just mindlessly butcher me.'

In the Shadow of the Flying Mountain~
Incredibly, above you, suspended in mid-air, is a huge mountain. You
bob in the shallow waters shaded by the flying mountain. You crane your
neck upward and see high above you massive chains and winches which
support many pirate ships beneath the flying mountain. Also, high above
you, you can make out a rope ladder. Sadly the ladder, too, has been 
wound most of the way up, and is far out of your reach. Your boat bumps
a buoy.

   It's amazing, but the water here seems to look shallower, although
you know that cannot be true at this distyle from the shores. It
almost looks like magic could be at play at this particular spot --
which causes you to remember back to an old tale of an underwater city
somewhere in these waters....

inscription strange rock~
Carved into the rock in wizard runes is the following:
` BEWARE-Enchanted Lodestone: I was on holiday on this 
deserted island, practicing on my enchantment spells, 
when in the middle of casting, I was rudely interrupted by
a mystic summons. The interruption threw my spell off target
and onto the island itself. With a wrenching crunch the whole
island rose from the sea to the position you find it now. 
Intrigued by the phenomena I took a sample of the rock back
to my shack in the Forest Arden, where I determined by 
methods of alchemy that the island had rich deposits of
lodestone, which when subjected to enchantment magic, flies.
I have used this discovery to create several floating trinkets
which impart the ability of flying to the recipient. Beware
for I know not how long this enchantment will last. - MERLIN'

about the fire, and primitive shelving has been carved into the surrounding 
stalagmites. The heat from the fire is so great that it has melted the ice into
a pool of water.
