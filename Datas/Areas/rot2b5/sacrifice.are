Looking around, you see nothing but water as far as the eye can see.
You seem to have gotten turned around, and wish you had a compass about

A small Dock~
You are standing on a small dock extending out into a large pool of water.
A huge waterfall to your west sprays you with a cool mist.  A small shack
is here with a sign that reads "{BBert's Boats{x".
         A sign is nailed to a post at the edge of the dock.
         Below the sign, a brass plaque glints in the light.
