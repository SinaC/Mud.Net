gardener~
a gardener~
A gardener works here, quietly tending to the plants.
~
The hands of this gardener are caked with dirt, as is much of the exposed
skin.  They smile kindly at you, however, and move so that they are not
blocking your path.  With a bit of a stooped back from constant bending
over, this gardener still looks quite sturdy and healthy.  Tanned skin
stretches in a few wrinkles from the sun.

Lord Malrick~
A man sits with his head bowed reverently, worshipping the gods.
~
Malrick, the more religious member of the family, sits here praying to
various gods for support and advice.  His brown hair keeps falling into his
eyes as he prays, but he does not get the least bit frustrated as he
continually brushes it back with slender hands.  His eyes are a deep brown,
and they are cast down to the ground in worship.

Tall and sturdy, this man holds within his eyes a gentle expression which
reflects the true generosity of his soul.  He loves his family deeply, and
works hard to keep them protected and in good hands.  His wavy black hair is
pushed out of his brilliant green eyes, and his broad shoulders seem to
dwarf the back of the chair in which he sits watching his relatives.

Before the Hedgemaze~
A large green wall rises to the north, signifying the borders of a thick
hedgemaze that guards the entrance to the manor of Kastalia.  The colors are
a vivid green, and they reach about 20 feet into the air, their thick
branches lacing together to form an impenetrable wall of thorny hedge.  The
ground is scattered with smooth gravel, that looks as though it has been
combed over with a heavy rake.

Thick green walls of evergreen rise up to mock you as you wander
aimlessly through the hedgemaze.  The hedges reach up into the sky at least
20 feet, their upper tips glinting with sunlight but near the bottom dark
and a bit dreary.  The air is still, the thick scent of evergreen never
moving or fading from its strong assault on your nostrils.  The hedges are
confusing, and you find yourself at intersections that all look rather
similar.

A Wide Gravel Path~
A wide gravel path leads here between the manor house and the thick
hedgemaze that guards it.  It seems well travelled, and the gravel is smooth
and level.  Trimmed grasses line the path, their green colors alternating in
a pattern that looks almost dizzying with its brightness.  To the distant
north the house of Kastalia rises, its brick facade and marbled columns
seeming to glow softly.  Before the manor house, the path is intercepted by
another, smaller path.

An Intersection of Paths~
Two well groomed gravel paths come to an intersection here, their smooth
surfaces seem level and quite often raked by the large gravel rakes you see
a few of the gardeners carrying.  To the south a ways, a large hedgemaze
rises up towards the sky and brightly shines with its vivid forest green
colors, while to the north you can see the manor house of Kastalia.  East
the stablehouses are found, and to the west the path leads on a bit into a
topiary garden.

A Wide, Gravelled Path~
The smooth gravel of the path is well rounded, with no sharp edges to
poke through soft boots on this path that heads east towards a path
intersection, and west towards a topiary garden that rises from the ground
in the distance.  Trimmed, healthy grass glows with a vivid green glimmer as
it lines the path to the north and south, no weeds or misplaced flowers to
be seen at all.  Tidy flower gardens can be found in tight circles here and
there around the edges of the path, each flower tediously cared for and
breathtaking in their beauty.

A Wide, Gravelled Path~
A gravel path ends here at the entrance into a large, well-tended topiary
garden to the west.  The garden is surrounded by a low picket fence, its
wooden slats painted a bright white in color and gleaming softly in the
light.  The gravel along the path is all sized about the same, and is a soft
grey color.  It seems clean and as level as though somebody has dragged a
large rake across it.  Smooth, healthy grass lines the path to the north and
south, its tidy surface broken now and then by flower beds, bordered by
large stones.

The Topiary Garden~
A large, well-tended garden stretches out in your gaze.  The huge hedges
of a vivid green are trimmed and pruned up to look like magnificent
creatures, each lifelike and looking almost ready to hop off the small
pedestal they rest upon.  Small stone circles surround the bottoms of the
topiaries, followed by a circle of tiny, vividly colored flowers.  Beyond
the layer of flowers another circle of stones completes the borders.  Each
flower is bright and seems at the optimum of health, no dead leaves or
browned blossoms hanging from them.  The ground of the large garden is
covered in the same smooth gravels as the path leading to it.  Along the
outer edge of the garden a small, white picket fence can be seen.

Path to the Pond~
The grass grows up to about ankle level on this path which leads north to
the pond, and east into the topiary garden.  A few trees grow up to shade
the path, which seems not very often used.  The air seems quiet and still,
everything about seems quite serene.  The grass is a vivid green, and it
waves softly in ripples with a gentle breeze that greets you with its soft
caress.

the topiary garden and the isolated pond.

leaves falling down now and then to land softly in your path.

Path to the Pond~
You stand at the northern end of a path that leads north into a lush
pond.  A soft breeze brushes past now and then, bringing with it the faintly
muddy, fishy fragrance of the pondwater with it.  Long grasses ripple and
wave in the breeze, a few wildflowers growing amongst them.  The pond
stretches to the northwest, soft grasses leading down to the water's edge. 
The entire area seems to have a serene feel to it.

across the surface.  The air smells a bit muddy, and has the faint hint of
fish to its fragrance.

at moss drifting across the surface or to snatch the fish who gets too close
to the surface.  The grasses are long and vividly green, they wave slowly in
the breeze.  The path leads east and west around the pond.

muddy water on the breeze.  A large willow tree sits almost at the water's
edge, its branches dangling against the water, causing it to ripple
slightly.  The grasses under the tree are a bit flattened, like someone sits
here often.

the water occassionally, and every so often are captured by a flying
kingfisher.

he'd almost be unnoticeably except that his fishing pole stretches out over
the waters.

flower is bright and seems at the optimum of health, no dead leaves or

The Path to the Stables~
A smooth gravel path leads east and west here.  A short distance to the
east the wooden building that houses the stables can be seen.  On either
side of the path thick, bright green grass grows healthily, looking as
though it is trimmed quite regularly.  A fresh scent fills the air, along
with the not-so-fresh scent that has drifted west on the wind from the
stables.

Before the Stables~
A gravel path ends at the doors to a large stable house.  The walls of
the stable are grey and weathered a bit, but seem quite sturdy and solid
despite their age.  A few knotholes and odd grains can be seen.  The scent
of the stables is a bit thick in the air, but its quite bearable.  The doors
are wide and have upper and lower sections, with bolts that hang open on
each section.  The path stretches to the west, while the doors open east.

dirt floor.  A few large posts rise up, and the beams in the ceiling are
visible beneath the thick thatching of the roof.  A few harnesses hang from
large hooks in the wall, as well as some leftover horseshoes and one or two
saddles.  To the east a hallway stretches north and south along the stalls.

and only covered with a very thin layer of loose dirt.  To the east the
halfdoor of a stall rests in its closed position, the head of a horse
hanging a bit curiously over it and peering at you.

Hallway in the Stables~
The hallway stretches north and south between the rather roomy stalls of
the stable here.  A hard-packed dirt floor stretches beneath you, well swept
and only covered with a very thin layer of loose dirt.  To the east and
west, the halfdoors of stalls rest in their closed positions, horses leaning
their heads out and watching you curiously.  The fresh scent of horses fills
the air, as well as the sounds of their restless motions.  A few horseshoes
hang on the beams on either sides of the stalls, as well as saddles and a
few blankets, harnesses and bits.

A Horse Stall~
A fresh pile of hay lines one end of the stall, a few pieces straggling
out across the rest of the stall from the horse wriggling and prancing a bit
restlessly.  The walls are built of extremely smooth wood, with not a stray
splinter to be found that might gouge into a horse's flesh and cause an
infection.  A few piles of horse manure lay here and there, but it is
otherwise a very clean and fresh smelling stall.

A Path Leading to the Manor~
A wide gravelled path leads north and south here, the smooth stones of
the gravel gleaming with a clean glow.  The sides of the path are lined with
trimmed, healthy grass that is a vivid green, and looks as if a gardener
spends every day tending it.  A short distance south is an intersection of
paths, while to the north immediately are two guard houses, lining the path
on either side.  Further north the large, dull red bricks of the manor can
be seen behind the stately pillars that support it.

Between the Guard Houses~
The gravel path stretches between two guard houses of medium size here. 
The houses are made of sturdy wood, with a few bricks to support them, all a
bit faded from the weather but still holding up strong.  Their doors are
open to the east and west, showing their somewhat spartan interiors.  You
can see the guards eyeing you curiously from inside the house, but they make
no moves to stop you as you walk past.  The air smells fresh and clean here,
and in the far distance to the south the hedgemaze standing tall.  A short
distance to the north the stately manor house of Kastalia rises majestically
into the air.

A Guard House~
A guard house of generous size guards the sides of the path.  The door
sits wide open, allowing an easy view of the path outside.  The room is
decorated sparsely, with a low wooden counter, benches, and a few
decorations on the wall.  Large windows look out across the vast green
lawns, towards the hedge and towards the house itself.  The walls are of
sturdy wood that looks quite strong despite its apparent age.  The thick
scent of the thatch roof above sends an almost comforting aura into the
room.

On the Path at the Doors~
A set of double doors rises up to the immediate north.  Their height must
reach at least 20 feet up against the walls of the manor, with a faint arch
to them.  The doors are made of deep mahogany colored wood, and they look
impossibly heavy and sturdy.  Intricate patterns of gold inlay are swirled
across the doors, with a few gems firmly imbedded into the dark grains. 
They seem to twinkle and wink merrily at you in a glimmer of light.  The
brick walls of the manor rise up around the doors, and to the east and west
tall pillars that support a roof overhang above stand proudly.  The pillars
are carved of a smooth white marble, with the faintest of red veins in it
that matches the colors of the brick perfectly.  A gold and silver plated
plaque can be seen next to the doors, along with a huge knocking device.  A
path leads to the east, headed towards the rose gardens.

The Winding Path~
This smooth gravel path leads off from the main path towards the Lady
Gwyndalyn's rose gardens.  The gardens are reknowned far and wide for their
intense beauty and the exotic blend of colors she manages to produce.  The
path seems quiet, with only the soft crunch of gravel now and then to keep
you company.  A soft breeze blows from the east, carrying with it the heady
fragrance of hundreds of roses.  To the north the walls of the manor house
rise up, and to the southeast the stables can be seen.  The path stretches
on to the east past the walls of the house.

The Winding Path~
The path stretches smoothly between the main path to the west, and the
famous rose gardens of Kastalia to the east.  The gravel is smooth and seems
well combed of any jagged rocks that might poke up through the soft soles of
boots.  Well-trimmed grass lines the path, and a few flower beds can be seen
here and there as you make your way down the path.  Now and then a bird call
echoes throughout the air, and soft breezes brush past you bringing with
them the soft scent of roses.  Far in the distance to the south the
hedgemaze rises almost tauntingly, and to the northwest the manor house sits
proudly.

The Winding Path~
The path picks its winding way through the lawns of Kastalia, heading in
a generally eastish direction towards Lady Gwyndalyn's rose gardens.  A
breeze brings with it the scent of roses, and you can see the gardens in the
near distance.  A gazebo rests sedately in the center of what seems to be an
organized disarray of color and shapes.  To the south, the path winds its
way lazily towards the main path to the west, and to the east it continues
towards the garden.  The manor house watches silently over the rest of the
manor to the distant west, while almost directly south a ways the roof of
the stables can be seen.

The Entrance to the Rose Gardens~
To the east, a beautiful rose garden sits proudly in the light.  The
roses seem tall and amazingly brilliant, and a faintly magical hum seems to
fill the air.  A gazebo rises in the center of the rose garden, its white
painted phasepine gleaming faintly.  The thick scent of roses is heavy on
the air, as well as the buzzing of a few bees that flit from flower to
flower.  To the west, a gravel path begins and heads in the general
direction of the manor house.
 
A small sign rests next to the entrance of the garden.

The Rose Gardens~
Amazingly tall roses reach up five feet into the air, their buds
measuring a foot across.  Every color of the rainbow is represented in this
garden, and some colors you have never even imagined before as well.  The
smell of the roses is almost intoxicating in its headiness, and the soft
drone of the bees buzzing about fills the air.  The path beneath your feet
is covered with soft moss, that springs back lightly after each footstep.  A
breeze brushes through the garden from time to time, causing the rose bushes
to shift slightly, their vicious looking thorns jutting inches from your
skin.  Something seems to move among the bushes, perhaps it is just a bird
who has made its nest in the wildly growing jungle of roses.  A gazebo rests
in the center of the rose garden.  The path heads west towards the house,
and east into the gazebo.  North and south leads into the garden itself.

The gazebo is quite large, and shaped a bit like a crescent moon.  It is
built of smooth phasepine, and has symbols of the moon in various phases
etched into it.  From here you can gaze out upon the garden without much
fear of beestings or getting pricked by stray thorns.  You notice that the
bushes seem to shift about slightly, almost as if they were moving on their
own.

The gazebo is quite large, and shaped a bit like a crescent moon.  It is
built of smooth phasepine, and has symbols of the moon in various phases
etched into it.  From here you can gaze out upon the garden without much
fear of beestings or getting pricked by stray thorns.  You notice that the
bushes seem to shift about slightly, almost as if they were moving on their
own.

An Entrance Hall~
The floor stretches seemingly endlessly in this large entrance hall. 
Smoothed of a finely polished marble, it gleams softly and footsteps echo
faintly about the hall.  Large marble pillars rise up to the ceiling far
above now and again, supporting the ceiling above.  The ceiling is painted
with beautiful frescoes and mosaic designs of the gods.  A door breaks the
wall to the south, leading outside the manor.  The hallway itself stretches
east, west, and north from this point.

An Entrance Hall~
The entrance hall comes to a corner here, the smooth, wood-panelled walls
seeming to come together with hardly even a seam.  A large statue stands in
the corner, in front of a pillar that reaches its marble length up to
support the painted ceiling overhead.  The floors are made of a smooth
marble that gleams with a freshly-cleaned glow.  The hall stretches east and
north, where the echoes of footsteps on marble can be heard.

with mosaics and frescos depicting the gods in their various duties.  The
wall to the west is completely smooth and shines softly with dark stain, and
looks as though it was freshly washed down.  A painting adorns the wall, as
do a few lights that glow with a magical light, shedding brilliance about
the hall.  The hall stretches on to the north, east, and south.

An Entrance Hall~
The large entrance hall stretches in every direction around you, its
smooth marble flooring gleaming with its soft, clean glow.  A few echoes of
footsteps upon the marble echo about as people move to and fro, accompanied
by soft laughter that bounces off the smooth wooden walls on the borders of
the massive hall.  The ceiling reaches high above, supported by a collonade
of marble pillars.  Beautiful hand painted murals adorn the ceiling, their
images looking lifelike as they depict the heroic actions of a time long
ago.

You stand at the northern end of the entrance hall to the manor of
Kastalia.  To the north a large set of double doors leads to the main
section of the manor, each door reaching 15 feet in height and decorated
with various gems and silver leafing.  The vast entrance hall stretches
east, west, and south.  Marble floors that echo soft footsteps like tiny
tapping noises form the ground, while magnificent artwork decorates the
ceiling far above.

patterns so small and softly colored that they seem almost a trick of the
light.  A pillar rises in this corner to support the ceiling, and a few
echoes of laughter can be heard down the guest hallway beyond the door.

The most prominent feature in this room is a large instrument that looks
much like a piano.  Instead of pedals, however, it has a few small harp-like
strings that one would pick at with a tool clipped onto one's shoes.  In a
corner of the room a large harp sits, its strings humming with energy.  A
few flutes, lutes, and lyres hang from the walls, as well as some strange
instruments that arent readily identifiable.  The room is large, bright and
airy, with sheets of music collected in shelves on the walls.  The ceiling
is painted with large music notes and musical scores.  A window looks north
over the grounds.

The Room of the Stars~
This is the room where the denizens of the castle come to study up on
their astrology, consult the star maps and see what the skies have in store
for them.  The walls are literally wallpapered with star charts that show
every constellation and star cluster.  Huge books lay open, their pages well
worn and marked, teaching of the various meanings of astrology.  The ceiling
above is painted to look like a night sky, with the stars so bright and
vivid it seems that one could reach up and grab them down from their resting
places.  At the window a strange contraption with an eyepiece pokes through
a hole in the window and aims up at the sky.  A door leads south to the
hallway.

A Sitting Room~
A large, magically lit sitting room greets your gaze.  The walls are
smooth and shining, and they are adorned with a few magical lights as well
as portraits and paintings of various types.  A tapestry hangs on one wall,
depicting the pond out to the west of the manor.  It seems to shimmer and
change now and then, as if updating to a current scene.  For now, a small
boy is snoozing while is bait is nibbled by large fish under the water.  The
ceiling above is decorated with a lovely gold leaf, as well as the door to
the south.  A few chairs beckon with comfortable looking cushions, and some
low tables serve as drinkstands.

it shines softly, reflecting the magically glowing lights on the walls.  The

A large table dominates this room.  Built of solid mahogany, it gleams
softly in the light shining in from a window to the south.  Magically
glowing torches rest in holders against the walls, their reflections
mirrored on the smooth surface of the table.  A few chairs are surrounding
the table; they look rather comfortable and expensive.  The marble floor is
partially covered in a thick rug, patterned with what seems to be the
illusion of fairy wings.  A large portrait rests on the wall.

and have only a single pillow.  A quick touch would reveal that they are not
soft like normal feather beds, but instead made of a harder substance.  The
wooden planked walls are bare, but despite their lack of decoration they

The chapel here seems solemn and silent, only broken by the occassional
soft tinkle of bells near the altar to the east.  North and south a few pews
stretch, and the aisle between them is carpetted in a lush, white rug that
has faint holy symbols sewn into it.  Huge windows arch, giving the entire
chapel a bright, airy look.  The ceiling is high, and crossed with a few
beams.  Between the beams beautiful mosaics have been painted, the holy eyes
of the figures represented seeming to glow with a magical light that bathes
the room.  Double doors lead west towards the hallway.

A large altar stretches here, before a stained glass window that
stretches 10 feet across and more than 20 feet high.  The altar is of deep
grey marble, and the swirls of color in the marble seem alive, sliding and
writhing faintly.  A white and red cloth is draped across the altar, and
folded upon itself in an intricate design.  A few holy books lay across the
altar, as well as some scrolls and statues.  A stick of incense burns at
each end of the altar, sending the musky scent of spices throughout the
chapel.  The stained glass above the altar shows an image of each god, in
all of their glory.

lead into the receiving room of the Kastal family, the place where everyone
meets and pays their respects to the Lord and Lady.  The hum of conversation
and laughter can be heard through the door, and the air is quite bright and
fresh.  Everything gleams with a well-tended shine.

A grand meeting hall stretches forth from this point to the east, west,

of chairs to the north.  The ceiling above is vaulted and extremely high, a
few gold leafings cover it but it mainly shows paintings of clouds.  It
looks as though there is no ceiling at all, but a gold bordered window that
peers into the air.  You can tell this is not so, however, for here and
there lights can be seen casting shadows upon the ceiling.  The floor below
has a beautifully woven red carpet that leads north to the foot of the twin
chairs.  Beneath the carpet the floor is of marble, and it shines softly
with a freshly cleaned gleam.

quite cozy and warm, with magical lights hanging from the ceiling that shed
a gentle light upon the entire room.

Gwyndalyn's Suite~
Doors lead south onto the magnificent balcony from here, their glass
stained to appear as the very image of a rose in bloom.  The colors shine
onto the floor in the pattern of the flower as the sun shines through the
glass.  In the far distance through the glass the hedgemaze can be seen. 
The soft scent of flowers fills the air, probably due to the fact that they
are everywhere in this room.  
Almost incongrous to the rest of the room are marks and scuffs on the carpet, having almost frayed it in places.  To be in such a state in an otherwise well tended room he marks must indeed be recent.

Gwyndalyn's Suite~
A childs crib is here, carved of white phasepine and imbued with the
symbols of the moon in her various phases.  A small toy lays snuggled in the
crib, along with a tiny baby that sleeps soundly.  The walls here seem to
magically shift colors now and then, from a soft white to a soft pink color
and then back again.  The suite stretches south and west from here.

Gwyndalyn's Suite~
Lady Gwyndalyn's bed takes up a good portion of this corner.  It is quite
tall, with a canopy the shade of the purest of white snows, and drapes that
are fashioned to look like intertwining rose blossoms.  The quilt thrown
across the bed is also designed with matching roses, and the bed looks soft
and inviting.  The high ceiling above is silver leafed, and has a few moons
painted upon it, while the carpetting is designed with flowers.  A single
rose lays on the pillow of the bed.

Gwyndalyn's Suite~
A comfortable looking couch is set against the wall here, its cushions
quite dented and seeming a bit well worn.  A table in front of the couch has
an assortment of gardening books and children's story books, as well as a
couple stuffed animals.  The Lady Gwyndalyn must spend a good deal of her
time sitting here reading, either to herself or to one of the children.  A
bit of knitting lays discarded on the couch.

The Balcony~
This wide balcony stretches out around the entire second level of the
manor house of the Kastal family.  The edges are supported by a thick
railing that seems quite sturdy, even when leaned quite heavily upon.  From
here you can gaze quite a ways into the distance; everything seems peaceful
and far off in this family sanctuary.  A glass door leads into someones
bedroom.

A Carpeted Hallway~
A wide, lushly carpeted hallway stretches east and west here.  The carpet
is thick, and soft, springing back beneath your feet to cushion every step. 
The vaulted ceiling above has the faint designs of gold leafing upon it,
which reflect the soft lights of magical torches hanging here and there. 
Another hallway meets with this one to the west, while to the east the
hallway leads towards some suites.  To the south, the bottom of some stairs
can be seen.

The Stairs to the Attic~
The stairs leading up here somehow seem dark and gloomy, despite the
warmth and brightness of the surrounding hallway.  The stairs creak as if
rarely used, and each footstep brings up a poof of dust into the air that is
causing your nose to itch slightly.  At the top of the stairs a door blocks
the way into the attic, perhaps that door was put there for a reason.

A Carpeted Hallway~
The hallway stretches east and west here.  The wooden walls shine softly
with a waxed gleam, as do the floorboards extending beyond the carpet that
runs down the center of the hall.  The carpet itself is a deep purple color,
swirled with designs of a lighter purple.  To the north, a door leads into
Karynna's suite, where the murmur of conversation can be heard through the
door.  To the south, all is silent from the door leading into Malrick's
room.

Karynna's suite is quite large, and stretches to the east and west.  To
the east, a large bed dominates the room.  Faint giggles can be heard from
that direction, along with a deep voice now and then.  To the west is
Karynna's wardrobe.  This section of her room is filled with two large
chairs that face the door north, which steps out onto the balcony.  Sun
streams in through the almost transparent cloths that hang down over the
glass.

Karynna's Suite~
A large, wooden wardrobe made from the wood of a rare moontree, takes up
most of this section of the room.  It is designed with soft, flowery looking
carvings..  A few gems form the petals of the flowers.  It seems quite
intricately designed, and filled to the brim with clothing that sticks out
from the semi-open doors.  A thick carpet of pure white covers the floor,
and the wooden walls are painted a white to match.  On one wall a single,
purple rose is painted.

A beam of sunlight shines through the windows to the north to light upon
the large, canopied bed here.  Drapes hanging around the bed are pulled to
the side, their translucent lengths parted to reveal a soft bed with the
sheets rumpled.  The pillows have two indentations in them, and you notice
Karynna seems to not be alone in her room..

magical heat that keeps the hallway comfortable.  The arched ceiling above
is decorated with gold leafing, and the carpet beneath is of a deep purple
color.

Malrick's Suite~
A vast, but very simple room meets your gaze.  The only decoration in the
entire room is a large mural painted on the ceiling, depicting the image of
one of the gods of the realm.  She watches serenely over the room from her
painted surroundings, her eyes seeming to glow with a faint light.  The bed
is in the eastern corner, while the western corner holds Malrick's wardrobe
and bookshelves.  A door leads north into the hallway, and one opens south
out onto the balcony.

very plain clothing, all dull colored and sturdy in nature.

A rather small bed seems to sit almost humbly against the eastern wall. 
It is covered with a simple black blanket, and has a single pillow upon it. 
It even seems rather hard, not like the soft bed you'd expect from a member
of this noble family.  The floor is bare, and the wooden planks kept well
swept and clean.  The walls are bare as well, and a single candle rests on a
table next to the bed, along with a book.

The attic stretches endlessly, the dark shadows seeming to swallow what
meager light you cast.  Cobwebs hang from the ceiling, and stretch all the
way to the floor.  A thick layer of dust covers everything, and large crates
and old furniture make travelling around here quite a hazard.  You begin to
feel lost as you wander among the relics of Kastalia's past, and soft
whispers seem to fill the air as a cold draft brushes through the attic. 
You get the feeling that you're not alone.

The Attic~
The attic stretches endlessly, the dark shadows seeming to swallow what
meager light you cast.  Cobwebs hang from the ceiling, and stretch all the
way to the floor.  A thick layer of dust covers everything, and large crates
and old furniture make travelling around here quite a hazard.  You begin to
feel lost as you wander among the relics of Kastalia's past, and soft
whispers seem to fill the air as a cold draft brushes through the attic. 
You get the feeling that you're not alone.

Gwyndalyn's Suite~
A large wardrobe sits in the corner here, the doors firmly shut and
silver leafing etched in beautiful flowery designs along the surfaces.  The
carpetting beneath your feet is a soft white color, imprinted with the
designs of millions of flowers, and the floorboards that peek out from
beneath the rug are a soft white that shine with a freshly cleaned gleam. 
Sun shines in through the window along the southern wall.
