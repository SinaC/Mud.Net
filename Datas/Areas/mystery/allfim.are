access facing each of the cardinal directions.  The shrine is made of bronze
with gold leaf.  It has four corners, each with a flared out edge.  The
entire enitire structure is about five stories high.  There are metal
dragons wrapped about the outside of it's massive dome.  Within it you see
many praying monks.  There is a single, huge, bronze bell of beuatiful
craftsmanship in it's center.  There appears to be a group of monks not
praying, but discussing.  Occasionally they look at you.

walls are bare wood, and have nothing on the.  There is the occational
window.  On the east wall there is a door that leads to the kitchen.

trees, you can hear nirds sing from within them.  You have the feeling that
all is not what it appears with this scene.  To the south, you think you

more like something sucked the color from the land when it sucked the spirit
away.  The entire battlefield has the look of a black and white movie. 
Except that there is color.  You can see it, your not quite sure where, but
there is color.  To the north there appears to be a group of tents.

color~
After concenrating on this confusing image of a colorless landscape that

walked about you get the impression that the war doesn't go well. The torn
banners of the Togashi clan fly in the middle of the camp.

There is a camp to the north.  You can see people walking around between
the tents.  There are a few horses in the camp too, but mostly just people
carrying spears.  There is no happiness in the movment or actions of these
people.  In truth they are acting as if all their strength had been sapped. 
To the east is the rest of the grey, desolete battlefield.

Outside an Army Encampment~
This is where the army of Lin-Po have made camp.  A few unattentive
guards stand around, leaning on their spears.  They wounded lay in the mud,
writhing in agony.  The strange thing about the wounded is that they make no
sound from their pain.  The soldiers that are sitting about seem to be
oblivious to their injured comrades.

Outside the Barracks~
You are located outside the tents where the soldiers stay.  The tents are
full, the tents are silent.  There is movement within them, but very little
and very discrete.  The blowing breeze flaps the walls of the tents.  You
think you hear sobbing.  To the east is where the samurai'stay, to the south
the ashagaru.

The Edge of the Lin-Po Camp~
No one here seems to pay any attention to you, or anything else.  The
dying lay in the mud.  The living lay in the mud.  There are some whose
intestine hang out, yet still the soldiers of the camp do nothing but step
over them.  You can hear someone giving instructions, but you can't tell
where.  Few seem attentive to the situation of the camp.  The banners of the
the army of Lin-Po wave bravely  
in the wind.

This is the middle of a dismal battlefield.  Death and destruction
surround you on all sides.  There is nothing happy here, only the grayness
of war.  The winds blow.  With them come the cries of the dead, and the sobs
of the damned.  To the west you see a camping army, and to the east you see
the same.

go-moku with each other when one or the other requests it.  They then come
here and play each other until they feel ready to fight again.  There are
several samurai and their attendants here.  They all appear to be watching a
single game.  Everyone is quiet, but the feeling of doom isn't as strong as
it is in the rest of the field.

The Edge of the Battlefield~
You are at the northern edge of a great battlefield.  Before you sits a
land devoid of life, devoid of its color, devoid of its hope.  A battle has
raged here for centuries with neither side coming any closer to winning. 
The sky, earth, and everything you see is gray.  Even where there is color,
there is a gray sadness to it.  The combatant pawns of battle know that
nothing is their future, but to die.  This is a vast wasteland of grey
death, it is all that is to the south.

This is where the peasant soldiers stay.  Thoses that are here seem to
be sleeping with their eyes open.  They look as if they have stopped being
scared of death, and are only scarred of the pain before one dies.  Their
equipment sits at their feet.  The ground here is mud, with a few remnants
of grass.  The tent is some thin rough material, and poles are dispursed
regularly throughout the tent.  Here, as everywhere, the predominant color
is gray.

darts in or out of the tent.  This tent has the most life you've seen in the
entire camp.  The gray here seems washed out by the soft light of a lantern
within the tent.  Not to far to the east, down a small path, is a large

other attendents.  Everyone in here is wearing armor, and bares a weapon. 
The walls are covered with trophies of various sorts.  It is apparent that

Here is where the business takes place.  There is a seat for the head of
the clan, all others must sit on pillows before him.  There are paintings on
the walls, and doors leading in many directions.  The court is full of
people.  They all have impeccable manners, even though they whisper to one
another about things best not heard.

Off a ways to the east is something that appears to be a giant bush.

An Open Field~
You can see a river twist around the low hills of the land.  It is the
only moving thing for miles, save a few animals.  The river is off to the
northwest.  To the northeast is a sweeping valley.  You think you can make
out two encampments within it.  After a few seconds you realize that instead
of green, the ground of the valley is an unnature grey.

A Sparse Forest~
A forest forms, getting thicker westard.  It is made up of tall thin
trees, conifirs, and the occational bamboo.  Even though life is evident
(you can see it move among the trees) you still feel as though this place is
empty.  Add to that the inexplicable felling that your being watched, and
you can't help but check the readiness of your weapons and armor.

Bamboo Forest~
The transition to bamboo forest is complete.  You here monkeys jump in
the trees.  The Bamboo is hard to make you way through, but you manage.  You
are aware of so much life in this forest.  For now the bland fields of grass
are only a memory.  This place is full of life, but has no smell.  Except
for the faint, ever present, aroma of manure.

A Darker Part of the Forest~
The forest becomes thinker here.  A strange contrast to the empty plains
which you had moments ago travelled.  A you wander among the large trees you
realize the forest is utterly silent.  There is only a faint rustling, which
seems to come from every diection.  It's probably just the wind.  Though you
can't help think that maybe it's not.  This forest has a ordered look to it,
almost artifical in it's naturalness.  Some dead bushes are especially out
of place you think.

The Entrance to the Lair of Clan Blood Dawn~
A bamboo ladder goes into the ground about 4 meters.  The dirt is held in
place by support planks that have been fixed to the wall.  At the bottom a
flag is draped as a door across the entrance to this place.  The flags show
a red sun rising over two crossed swords.  Welcome to the Lair of Clan Blood

A Wooden Path~
A path starts here, made up of thin sticks lain side-by-side.  They
appear to be well worn, and pressed firmly into the soft dirt.  This is the
only sign that other people have been around here.  I light wind blows from
the east, and you can actually smell the grass.  It's almost as if the
meadow actually starts to the east of here, and this massive barren field is
just a living blight of the land

can hear the light sound of bells coming from inside it.

little pond of crystal clear water.  Around that pond are five medium sized
rocks.  They have a worn appearence to them.  On one of the rocks sits a
monk.  His head is shaved and covered with tattoos.  He is dressed in white
and yellow robes.  His eyes are closed, and he appears content with the

of a dark and lavish wood.  It seems to be brand new, or at least aging very
well.  There is a man, on the other side of the river beckoning for you to

covered road.  It heads off to the north, and meets a large compound some
ways from here.

A Point Above the Battlegrounds~
You stand at a cliff overlooking a great grey valley.  Soldiers, and the
signs of war are scattered thoughout the field.  The battle continues before
your eyes.  There is an occational arrow shot, or a sword duel.  Every
action seems to be done very slowly and with delibration.  For the most part
the combatants seem to be asleep, or completely drained of energy by their
owe sorrow.  A army is not camped to far to the north of here.  To the south
are the vast green expanses of the empty meadow ,and there appears to be a
path down to the valley west of here.

You stand on the edge of what appears to be a great battlefield in a
valley.  War banners stand where their carriers have fallen.  Horses lay
dead, carts full of the dead lay abandon.  A few people move slowly around
the field, they all wear a sort of decorated platemail.  As you look at the
armor, you begin to notice that the predominate color is gray.  In fact,
even the grass has gray hues to it.  The sky here is as gray, as the sky
anywhere else is blue.  You can feel despair pour from the ground, and soak
the valley in hopelessness.

This path is here for a reason, to lead people to the large walled area
you see not too far to the north.  The path is about two meters wide and
covered with smooth elipsiod pebbels.  There are places where they have
clearly been kicked up by feet, and maybe hooves.  You see several eagles
flying in the air, and the sound of crickets is strong here.  The path goes
north toward a compound, and south to a bridge.
