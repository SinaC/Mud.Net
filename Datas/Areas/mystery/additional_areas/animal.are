Sir Hosis of the Liver~
Sir Hosis of the Liver stands before you.
~
Sir Hosis is a brave, proud man of middle years, who has sworn by
his God and his Honour to protect Animaland from harm until death
takes him from this world. He is a just man, though, and is more
than helpful and courteous to peaceful visitors.

A Knight who says "Ni!"~
A Knight who says "Ni!" demands a shrubbery from you.
~
This fellow is a rather odd, demented knight who has fallen from
his role as a protector of animal town to a lordless wanderer cursed
by the Witch to seek out shrubberies. The whole affair has made him
rather crabby, and he's likely to take it out on you!

The First Little Pig~
The First Little Pig oinks petulantly at you.
~
This stout little porker is the rather unwise porcine chap who built
his adobe from straw, infuriating insurance assessors and tempting
the BBW (Big Bad Wolf) into detroying it, until the pig's older brother
helped him out and deterred BBW from such activities.

The Second Little Pig~
The Second Little Pigs struts proudly outside his wooden A-frame.
~
This progressive porker decided to advance on his brother's work and
build a house of wood, slightly more attractive, but no less safe from
the BBW (not to mention nasty draughts and forest fires). He also ran
to the eldest pig for succor, and now everything's jake (for now).

This pig is a rather overbearing fellow with a nasty temper, but he is
nonetheless quite bright (he built his house of brick, remember?), and
fiercely protective of his younger brothers. He does not look
particularly happy to see you...This is not surprising considering the
fact that you've most probably jsut slain his brethren swine...

She did. But her idea of compatability appears to be a bit skewed... Poor
Poodle... Best bow or curtsey to her, she's very proud of her station and
doesn't take kindly to people who don't respect it. What's that? You're
not going to bow or curtsey to some stinking pre- abattoir t-bone?
Cowntess Heifer slaps you HARD! (You try not to cry).
Cowntess Heifer bonks you on the head! Are you going to take that?
Cowntess Heifer's pound ***IMPALES*** you! You sure are BLEEDING!

Since the anti-dwarves took over the mines and booted them out, the

their own. Wizard Owl has promised that once he gets into office all
that will change (he actually intends to put them into a high-rent
low-quality housing project that is being built near Troll Bridge
that he is part-owner of (once his Goats have kicked out the Troll
resident nearby:))).

The Path leading to Animaland~
You are strolling along a well-trodden path that leads towards the
boundaries of the mysterious realm of Animaland. At this point it
may not be inappropriate to consult your history books and learn
about the place (type `help animaland'). You see a broad, swiftly-
flowing river up ahead, which you can cross via a ford. However,
a well-armored knight standing outside a stone tower near the ford
makes you hesitate...
There is a sign here you may want to read...

As you near the ford, you also grow nearer this weathered stone tower,
which looks older than your Aunt Ethyl... A very odd-looking coat of arms
hangs above the door, which is stoutly locked (you can't go in, so don't
bother with this 'look door', 'op n', 'op door' crap ok? :P). The ford
look simple enough- step on and across the shallow bit to the other side,
which is very green and rather pleasant-looking.

Entrance to the Mines~
You have reached the entrance to the mines, a gaping maw that looms
in the side of a dark and forbidding cliff-face. With some trepidation,
you prepare to go in, but a sudden short burst of maniacal laughter
followed by a wet squelching sound makes you consider heading to the
forest instead...

 as yourself. However, we regret to inform you that the rape scene, the
 shoot-outs, the violent swearing witch and the Reservoir Dwarves

 Lost) are not quite what we here at Disney had in mind.

You are standing outside Poodle's room. He is likely to be in there. In
fact, he has been in there for two weeks, hiding from his wife and her
amorous advances...he has not the endurance he once possessed as a young
pup, and thus needs a break to rest his weary bones.

Inside Poodle's Chamber~
Poodle is an effeminate kind of guy. Oh sure, he tried to act all butch,
sticking swords and stuffed human heads  and such on his walls, and wearing
butch count-type stuff, but it all ends up looking rather ridiculous. So
in the end he gave up, and reverted to form, going for new-age color schemes,
gentle modern art sculpture, and literature by camp authors.

Sailing down the Fulem~
The current grabs at your boat and swiftly bears you downstream, towards
lake Cungerell in the distant south. Birds fly high overhead, conversing
with each other, and you imagine that you can also hear the fish in the
greeny depths beneath you quietly discussing philosophy and anthropology.

You have entered the Sanctum Sanctorum of The Wizard Owl. As you enter,
he regales you with a long string of calculations, asks your opinion on
their accuracy, then promptly whips out a book and begins to read.
Momentarily ignored, you glance about the room, amazed and impressed by
the range of alembics, beakers, cisterns, decanters, eggtimers, feathers,
gemstones, hangings, items, jpegs, krators, looms, manuals, necronomicons,
objects d'art, posters, question sheets, rulers, sheets, telescopes,
ultraviolet art, vampire bats, walrus tusks, x-ray machines, yellow powders
and zoo exhibits.
