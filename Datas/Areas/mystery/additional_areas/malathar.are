bow...

The Platinum Dragon~
The Platinum Dragon known as Haan, ally and friend of the Duke, sleeps here.
~
The mighty Haan served as the Duke's steed during the Goblin Wars many
centuries ago, but is now way past his prime, and he spends most of his
time sleeping and dreaming of past glories. For, long-lived as Wyrms are,
Elves are much longer-lived, being virtually immortal, and it saddens both
Haan and his master that their days together are now numbered.

other Elves, such is the love the Elves have for these beasts.

watchful presence of his God and Mentor, the Elven Immortal Yaegar. Tall

You have entered the sanctum of the Unicorns of of Malathar, close friends
and allies of the Elves of Malathar. However, despite their benevolent
nature, the Unicorns dislike intruders, especially armed and aggressive ones,
and will not hesitate to use extreme force to evict these intruders. In
addition, to protect these creatures, the Elven sorceror Tuo has placed
powerful enchantments on this place that prevent magical attacks on the
unicorns.

farmhouses and various creatures of the wild that stop to stare inquisitively
at you as you pass. The gates of the city are now visible, as are the guards
stationed near them, their colorful rainments dazzling you even from this

monument erected, dedicated to the many Elven Lords who died during the 
ferocious Goblin Wars that devastated most of the Elven Nations. The statue 
shows a band of Elves courageously defending an unarmed woman and her child 
from a band of hideous Goblins, and is quite brilliantly fashioned. There is
an inscription at the base of the statue.

occasionally a few, rendered inactive by sickness or injury or on leave will
be here, relaxing, talking, singing or meditating. They are not adverse to
visitors, and will happily chat with foreigners about distant lands, though
it would not do to act aggressively in the presence of these tough rangers.

places black plastic discs from which a rather odd sound emerges, along with
much scratching and hissing. He has quite a collection of these disks, which

Baleith Street~
You are heading along Balieth Street, which is home to the Guildmasters and
Guildmistresses of Malathar. At the far end, to the south, lies the tower
of the Elven Guildmaster, and the legendary Library of Malathar, while to
the north lies the opulent Palace of the Duke.

The Avian Guild is to the west of here, and the Illithid Guild to the east.

Avian Guild~
A strange, birdlike creature gazes curiously at you as you enter his Guild,
especially if you are a non-avian, for there is little he can teach you if
this is the case. Otherwise, the teacher recovers and sets out to teach you
what he can.

towering high into the sky, tapering to an unadorned point, in this case
housed in platinum sheeting. Guards occasionally march past, as do several
important-looking noblemen and women.

The Base of the Tower~
Entering the Tower, you find that you may proceed up or down, via elaborately
carved marble staircases, lit at regular intervals by Continual Light spells.
There is a desk on this level, unmanned, but which bears a register. There is
a large bulletin board on the wall behind the desk, between tall statues of
Aya and Mala, the Father and Mother of Learning in Elven Culture.

The register bears the names of all who have passed through the doors of
this great library, and as you watch incredulously, your own name appears
at the end of the list. Scanning the list you see such names as Lenny, Garth,
Rainman, Argh, Fle, Marc, Tempest, Marius, Cookie, Amadeus and Svelte, along 
with some names crossed out, such as Snikt, Gloppy and Dizzy.

The Top of the Tower~
Reaching the top of the tower, you come to a half-open door, which you are
able to barely push open, wedged as it is by a huge pile of books. Giving it 
a final shove, the door flies open, scattering books across the floor of the
dusty study you have entered, startling the Archmage Tuo, who to your growing
dismay is becoming very angry. He stares grimly at you as you stutter out an
apology, and simply demands that you fulfill whatever business you have with
him or begone forthwith.
You see a tattered scroll stuck to one wall.

  for one level.

  To enhance, type Enhance <stat> or Enhance 8 for Freedom From Nutrition.
  It will cost you 150000 gold and 300000 experience points, both of which
  will be deducted form your current stocks automatically. If you have
