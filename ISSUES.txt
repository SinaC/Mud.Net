when fighting multiple mobs
	when one mob dies and try to flee, we are not considered as fightning until next tick

TableGenerator with duplicate column and merge on same value doesn't work

when mud restarts and a player with quests reconnects, quest items are not recreated
  same goes if player destroy item, it cannot be found in world anymore
