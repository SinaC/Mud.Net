TODO:
train command
AbilityManager should not hardcode Rom24Passives
Cooldown
Second/Third/Fourth wield in insectoid
Dictionary to store Character known ability + keep only one LearnedAbility or replace with KnownAbilities getter based on name
CheckAbilityImprove: %age shoud be computed (or table) based on intelligence
Unit tests on spell/skill to check if method argument matches AbilityTarget, check if ItemInventoryOrCharacterDefensive have both dispel message
Spell with damage + effect (such as ColourSpray) can lead to strange behaviour -> damage kill victim then blindness is cast on victim  -> Damage should return if character has been killed
UnitTests CastFromItem/GetItemAbilityTarget
UnitTests on Rom24Effects
idea: move HP and move in ResourceKinds
rework resource system, Resource.None = 0 -> index 0 is used for nothing

AbilityTargets not yet handled:
	SpellCharmPerson(IAbility ability, int level, ICharacter caster, INonPlayableCharacter victim) // victim is NPC
	SpellVentriloquate(IAbility ability, int level, ICharacter caster, ICharacter victim, string parameter) // victim + raw parameter

DONE:
when load pfile with unknown resource kind -> crash in ToDictionary because multiple key -1 will be found
gain/practice command
restore command
HP/Move/Resources saved in pfile
remove CharacterBase.RecomputeCommands + StaticCommands + _fullCommands
Class/Race AddAbility additional parameters
Add/Merge abilities from race/class when PlayableCharacter is created/connected
AbilityManager reflection to gather abilities will not work because Spells are not static
    use new system to gather spell/skill/passive: find every class implementing an interface IAbilityImplementation
    those classes will have a predefined ctor with needed interfaces such as ISettings, IRandomManager, ...
Ability wears off message done
Generate skill command in ICharacter and tests Use
Skill practice %
Ability info by class/race
Cast resource/gain exp/check improve
Don't save invalid auras, better use of IsValid on Aura -> store an Aura list in World this will avoid looping on all room/character/item to check aura
Move, Resistances, Alignment added
Rom24 various flags added
Rom24 most spells added
.Net Random direct access removed from RandomManager 
ICharacter.Inventory is the same as Content 
AddAura duration in pulse and not second (-1: permanent)
    change aura/quest/... duration to TimeSpan
Save aura in CharacterData/ItemData
Aura with multiple modifiers
Add AddOrModifyAura to refactor test on GetAura then AddAura or Aura.Modify
Affects save
Full character/item data save
TableGenerator with duplicate columns
	 ----------------------
	|Name  | % || Name  | %|
	|------+---++-------+--|
	|Name1 | 1 || Name2 | 2|
	|Name3 | 3 || Name4 | 5|
	|Name5 | 5             |

*************************************************************

Use SafeList where List is used
Add daze to IPlayableCharacter: will be decreased like GCD and affects skill effectiveness
AddAura: additional param combine, when adding already existing aura (see affect_join)
Move CanSee in IEntity
Move AddAura in aura manager
store an Aura list in World this will avoid looping on all room/character/item to check aura
Save blueprint in Hashtable
CurrentAttributes, CurrentCharacterFlags, CurrentXXX should be accessible with indexers
Redo whole combat system
Add ctor to every manager with other manager as parameter to easy unit tests
Add aliases to PlayableCharacter
Replace out parameter with C#7-tuple if possible
Enum string representation instead of int in Repository
redo DoScore, DoAffects
check if IStat, MStat and RStat display new informations

gsn_backstab:
	reduce thac0 in one_hit
		thac0 -= 10 * (100 - get_skill(ch,gsn_backstab));
	damage is higher and depends on dagger or not
		if ( dt == gsn_backstab && wield != NULL) 
			if ( wield->value[0] != 2 )
			    dam *= 2 + (ch->level / 10); 
			else 
			    dam *= 2 + (ch->level / 8);


Redo modifiable list

PlayableCharacter can be immortal or not -> don't link immortality to ImpersonatedBy is IAdmin

When an item quest objective is complete, quest item should be NoTake

refactor RawKilled: found in NonPlayableCharacter and PlayableCharacter
IEquipable should not exist -> every item with a wear location should be equipable even if it's a furniture or a bag
When adding a container in a container, check if there is no cycle

refactor damage functions in OneHit, Ability, DamageHelpers

test group
     kill steal

cannot quit while affected by an harmful aura/periodic aura
while leaving(or reconnecting) aura should be removed ? maybe an additional flag saying if timer should decrease while disconnected ?

remove Send(..., bool addTrailingNewLine)
auto paging if data to send to too big?
check if RelativeDisplayName should be used instead of DisplayName in Command (check if CanSee should be used)

quest save completed quests
      quest tree (prereq)
      repeteable or not quests
      autogenerate

better command parser: should be able to specify something like     will be possible with SyntaxAttribute
    [command] [room.character] -> first parameter will be parsed as a character found in room
    [command] [world.character] -> first parameter will be parsed as a character found in world
    [command] [room.item|room.character|inventory.item|equipment.item] -> first will be parsed as an item in room, a character in room, an item in inventory, an item in equipement
wear item
     all
     all.item
look no arg
     in|on|into container
     character
     item
     extradescription
     direction

multitable generator, paging a table should repeat the header at the beginning of each page

autosac, autoloot, auto...
prompt

merge IAdminRepository and IPlayerRepository -> IAccountRepository

move blueprints to Mud.Domain + refactor Mud.Domain

IWorld: should create IReadonlyWorld which only contains getter

default error message with character command if not in correct position

casting time ? (-> spell interrupt is needed) --> delayed actions  [[http://www.mudmagic.com/codes/download/diku/merc/rom/snippets/skills_spells/tcasting.txt]]

act: add IPlayer, IAdmin -> Name or Impersonated.DisplayName

admin
    at(quite difficult to implement)
    most [MustBeImpersonated] command should work when incarnating
statistics: mob killed, player killed, ...

!! Stunned position is not very well used/defined
min pos to initiate command  see interp.C:935
use more StringBuilder
check if everywhere if Act should replace Send
use new act formatting: h, b, v whereas possible

prevent kill stealing: a player fights a mob, brings it to 1% and another player performs killing blow (using mob.Fighting)

aura/periodic aura can have multiply affects/effects
isValid on aura/periodic aura -> don't remove immediately aura/periodic aura + filter on isValid + remove them during Cleanup phease (--> no more clone of auras needed while modifying/clearing auras, same goes with periodic aura)

check wheelmud for mccp/mxp

each time operator IS or AS is used, this should be replaced with an overridable method
DoLook/DoExamine should be heavily modified to use Room.Display  Character.Display  (almost every functions in InfoCommands.cs)
IItem: Display(short/long) (used instead of FormatItem in InfoCommands.cs)
EquipedItem should be responsible for displaying itself
EquipedItem: Display (used instead of EquipmentSlotsToString on InfoCommands.cs)
