INGOING

TODO
use Export attribute instead of IRegistable (no contract type)
use Export for IClass, IRace, IXXXManager, ISanityCheck

remove every manual call to GetService/GetRequiredService
dangerous call sequence (luckily we set Room to NullRoom in the first lines of ctor):
    PlayableCharacter.ctor
        CharacterManager.AddNonPlayableCharacter (when creating pet)
            Room.Recompute
                Room.ApplyAuras which could kill PlayableCharacter we are trying to create
CharacterFactory, ItemFactory, RoomFactory to handle characters, items and rooms creation (to avoid new everywhere in the code and replace with DI more easily later if needed)

add energy/rage resource
cat form
    in Rom24, a skill can always be used even if Learned = 0, the skill must implement its behavior based on Learned
    -> add an additional parameter in attribute to disable this behavior, use only if known
    -> find a way to set a skill to 100%
!! current Form should affect the whole player: resource, spells, parts, ...
implement resource dynamically changed depending on some status (bear/cat/... form for druid)

fix this warning Logger.LogWarning("GameActionManager.CreateGameActionInfo: default game action info for type {0}", type.FullName ?? "???");
    set CommandAttribute and GameActionBase as abstract
    add ActorCommandAttribute and RoomCommandAttribute
    add ActorGameActionInfo and use as base class for PlayerGameActionInfo
    add RoomGameActionInfo and RoomGameAction

should see glowing item if in a dark room
glowing item on the floor of dark room should increase light

reimplement hot/dot

sanity check in server should be moved to dedicated classes
finish ROM24 classes
when a player connects, if no avatar found -> switch to avatar create state machine
move IClass/IRace to IPlayableCharacter as non-nullable
move IClass/IRace to INonPlayableCharacter as nullable
stop trying to be compatible with ROM24/Merc/Diku assume being Mystery mud :)
compatibility must only be in blueprint loading
check CanSee usage, if lambda can be removed
choose between flags as bits or strings (example RoomFlags and CharacterFlags)
check usage of OnCleaned/OnRemoved
stop cloning list and stop removing while iterating -> flag the entity as soft deleted and remove them in Cleanup phase

missing help: use dumpcommands

MIGRATION .NET 8
check all warnings and fix them
check all obsolete and fix them
check nullable reference types
check all properties for nullability (such as Room, ContainedInto, Race, Class, ...)
remove yield extension where not needed

UNIT TESTS
use xunit + moq

Item.GetAura should be based on flags and not ability (check Curse spell)
in general way, Aura should be based on flags instead of abilities (with an optional ability)

unit test for each command!!!
make IGameAction generic on TActor: IActor, same goes for IActionInput

make a map of calls done when a NPC is Removed/StopFollowing/...

commands dynamically added to Character depending on room they are, for example
	we could add list/buy/sell/value to commands if a shopkeeper is in the room
	brandish only when holding a staff

module/plugin to enable load on demand of skills/spells/commands/...

outfit command to give basic equipement
healer
pet shop
offensive flags: rescue, ...
clan/guild, auction house, socials, wimpy, note
commands: auction, channels, clantalk, compare, report, read, socials, whois, bet, brief, combine, compact, description, noloot, nosummon, outfit, prompt, title, wimpy, config, deaf, pmote, note, board, quote, nwrite,
	heal, autoaffect, wake, myclan, petition, clanlist

PK
furniture max weight (doesn't exist in Rom)
prevent kill stealing: a player fights a mob, brings it to 1% and another player performs killing blow (using mob.Fighting)
linkdead
Move CanSee in IEntity
each time operator IS or AS is used, this should be replaced with an overridable method
pull/push
Multiple wear location
quest: add quest item on the fly when player takes the quest or reconnect
item: protect, room_key
Monitor Recompute calls: recompute may leads to recursive call -> redo logic Unequip/Equip/ChangeContainer
Create item from blueprint with specific level and attributes (used for SpellFloatingDisc and other skill/spell creating item)
skills: lore
spells: create rose, farsight
assign abilities to classes
UnitTests on Rom24Effects
specials
assist_guard
aggro table
isValid on aura/periodic aura -> don't remove immediately aura/periodic aura + filter on isValid + remove them during Cleanup phease (--> no more clone of auras needed while modifying/clearing auras, same goes with periodic aura)
automated quests
quest history
leaving impersonation should not stop fighting -> PlayableCharacter can still died while not impersonated
  when impersonating, first search for impersonation in world -> use Guid !! should work if player disconnect/reconnect and reimpersonate
make text drunk in say/whisper/... see act_comm.C:2222
when using FindHelper.FindByName on ICharacter and parameter is self -> return itself
alignment at creation ?
Idea: move HP and move in ResourceKinds
Use SafeList where List is used
Add daze to IPlayableCharacter: will be decreased like GCD and affects skill effectiveness
store an Aura list in World this will avoid looping on all room/character/item to check aura
Save blueprint in Hashtable
Enum string representation instead of int in Repository
redo DoScore, DoAffects
check if IStat, MStat and RStat display new informations
When an item quest objective is complete, quest item should be NoTake or should be invisible
cannot quit while affected by an harmful aura/periodic aura
while leaving(or reconnecting) aura should be removed ? maybe an additional flag saying if timer should decrease while disconnected ?
remove Send(..., bool addTrailingNewLine)
auto paging if data to send to too big?
check if RelativeDisplayName should be used instead of DisplayName in Command (check if CanSee should be used)
quest save completed quests
      quest tree (prereq)
      repeteable or not quests
      autogenerate
better command parser: should be able to specify something like     will be possible with SyntaxAttribute
    [command] [room.character] -> first parameter will be parsed as a character found in room
    [command] [world.character] -> first parameter will be parsed as a character found in world
    [command] [room.item|room.character|inventory.item|equipment.item] -> first will be parsed as an item in room, a character in room, an item in inventory, an item in equipment
wear item
     all
     all.item
look no arg
     in|on|into container
     character
     item
     extradescription
     direction
multitable generator, paging a table should repeat the header at the beginning of each page
prompt modifiable by user
merge IAdminRepository and IPlayerRepository -> IAccountRepository
move blueprints to Mud.Domain + refactor Mud.Domain
IWorld: should create IReadonlyWorld which only contains getter

casting time ? (-> spell interrupt is needed) --> delayed actions  [[http://www.mudmagic.com/codes/download/diku/merc/rom/snippets/skills_spells/tcasting.txt]]

Loot table: http://www.gammon.com.au/forum/bbshowpost.php?bbsubject_id=9715
Its a bit more complex, but here is how one MMORPG that I am rather familiar with did it:
 You have two types of data:
 1. Treasure Tables
 2. Monster Treasure Lists
 A Treasure Table is a pre-defined set that contains a list of items, each with a given weight and maximum drop quantity. Weights are relative to the total weight of all items in the table. 
 TreasureTable_Spider
 - Spider Venom, weight=25, max=1
 - Spider Webbing, weight=65, max=1
 - Severed Spider Leg, weight=10, max=1
 This would give the Spider Venom a 25% chance of dropping if this table were called (25 / 100).
 Now, you also have Monster Treasure Lists. These are defined on the monster itself and refer to Treasure Tables using relative weights and max quantities. The monster also has a min/max of items it can drop (# of pulls from the tables).
 Spider
 - Min=1, Max=1
 - TreasureTable_Spider, weight=45, max=1
 - TreasureTable_RareLoot, weight=5, max=1
 - EmptyTreasureTable, weight=50, max=1
 So basically 50% of the time you would get no loot, 45% of the time you'd get something from TreasureTable_Spider and 5% of the time from TreasureTable_RareLoot.
 What this does is allows you to manage what mobs drop without having to alter each and every mob. You want to add another item to the rare loot table, next load it will be there and available to players.
 The downside to this system is it can be complex and it is harder to get an idea of the overall drop-rate of individual items. For example, if you were looking for Spider Webbing using the data above your effective % chance would be 29.25% (45% to call the Spider table, 65% to get Webbing inside that table).
