ongoing
Aura with multiple modifiers

todo
Alias should be available when impersonated: add aliases to PlayableCharacter
Ability wears off message
Move AddAura in aura manager
AddAura: additional param combine, when adding already existing aura (see affect_join)
Add AddOrModifyAura to refactor test on GetAura then AddAura or Aura.Modify
UnitTests on Rom24Effects
Add daze to IPlayableCharacter: will be decreased like GCD and affects skill effectiveness
Skill practice %
Refactor Ability

DONE:
Move, Resistances, Alignment added
Rom24 various flags added
Rom24 most spells added
.Net Random removed from RandomManager 
Move CanSee in IEntity
ICharacter.Inventory is the same as Content 
AddAura duration in pulse and not second (-1: permanent)
    change aura/quest/... duration to TimeSpan
Save aura in CharacterData/ItemData

-----------------------------------------------------
Redo modifiable list

PlayableCharacter can be immortal or not -> don't link immortality from ImpersonatedBy is IAdmin

When an item quest objective is complete, quest item should be NoTake

refactor RawKilled: found in NonPlayableCharacter and PlayableCharacter
IEquipable should not exist -> every item with a wear location should be equipable even if it's a furniture or a bag
When adding a container in a container, check if there is no cycle

refactor damage functions in OneHit, Ability, DamageHelpers

test group
     kill steal

cannot quit while affected by an harmful aura/periodic aura
while leaving(or reconnecting) aura should be removed ? maybe an additional flag saying if timer should decrease while disconnected ?

remove Send(..., bool addTrailingNewLine)
auto paging if data to send to too big?
check if RelativeDisplayName should be used instead of DisplayName in Command (check if CanSee should be used)

quest save completed quests
      quest tree (prereq)
      repeteable or not quests
      autogenerate

aura/cd: SecondsLeft should be used (decreased in pulse methods) instead of Start + Duration  without this modification, it will be almost impossible to save

better command parser: should be able to specify something like     will be possible with SyntaxAttribute
    [command] [room.character] -> first parameter will be parsed as a character found in room
    [command] [world.character] -> first parameter will be parsed as a character found in world
    [command] [room.item|room.character|inventory.item|equipment.item] -> first will be parsed as an item in room, a character in room, an item in inventory, an item in equipement
wear item
     all
     all.item
look no arg
     in|on|into container
     character
     item
     extradescription
     direction

multitable generator, paging a table should repeat the header at the beginning of each page

autosac, autoloot, auto...
prompt

merge IAdminRepository and IPlayerRepository -> IAccountRepository

move blueprints to Mud.Domain + refactor Mud.Domain

IWorld: should create IReadonlyWorld which only contains getter

default error message with character command if not in correct position

casting time ? (-> spell interrupt is needed) --> delayed actions  [[http://www.mudmagic.com/codes/download/diku/merc/rom/snippets/skills_spells/tcasting.txt]]

act: add IPlayer, IAdmin -> Name or Impersonated.DisplayName

admin
    at(quite difficult to implement)
    most [MustBeImpersonated] command should work when incarnating
statistics: mob killed, player killed, ...

!! Stunned position is not very well used/defined
min pos to initiate command  see interp.C:935
use more StringBuilder
check if everywhere if Act should replace Send
use new act formatting: h, b, v whereas possible

prevent kill stealing: a player fights a mob, brings it to 1% and another player performs killing blow (using mob.Fighting)

aura/periodic aura can have multiply affects/effects
isValid on aura/periodic aura -> don't remove immediately aura/periodic aura + filter on isValid + remove them during Cleanup phease (--> no more clone of auras needed while modifying/clearing auras, same goes with periodic aura)

check wheelmud for mccp/mxp

each time operator IS or AS is used, this should be replaced with an overridable method
DoLook/DoExamine should be heavily modified to use Room.Display  Character.Display  (almost every functions in InfoCommands.cs)
IItem: Display(short/long) (used instead of FormatItem in InfoCommands.cs)
EquipedItem should be responsible for displaying itself
EquipedItem: Display (used instead of EquipmentSlotsToString on InfoCommands.cs)
