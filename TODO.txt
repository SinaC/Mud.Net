INGOING
DONE
    pfile refactoring
    account: name, password, admin data(level, wiznet), avatar meta datas (name, version, level, class, race, location)
    avatar: character data
    accounts and avatars are stored in a dedicated folder

==========
== TODO ==
==========

rename PlayableCharacter Avatar
rename NonPlayableCharacter Mob

quests:
    2 types of ItemQuestObjective: found in QuestKillLookTable and found on the ground
        for the second one, we have to create item when getting quest or player is impersonated (and quest is ongoing) and item must be destroyed from ground when de-impersonated
    quest history
    quest save completed quests
    quest tree (prereq)
    repeteable or not quests
    (QUEST) flag on quest target should be optional

when losing connection, keep player in game during a few minutes in autoflee/recall mode and automatically impersonated when reconnecting
limbo/autoquit timer

use SafeList where List is used (everywhere except in XXXManager)

use resource cost for 'holy word': cost of 100% move and half hp

due to new AbilityLearned (cost/amount/resource removed), an ability cannot be added if not related to current class/race
    we should be able to add ability to a character even if not related to current class/race (for immortal for example)
    -> must artificially create an AbilityUsage for that purpose
    in fact, it's recompute known abilities which mess up learned abilities in pfile because it only considers racial abilities and abilities in learned groups

new combat system
    how to handle mob assist ?(ASSIST_PLAYER, ASSIST_RACE, ASSIST_ALIGN, ASSIST_VNUM, ASSIST_GROUP)
    for the moment auto assist is forced for PC
    kill reward
        first group to hit the mob will receive the reward
        if everyone in the group has been killed, reward priority goes to next group which has hit the mob
        prevent kill stealing: a player fights a mob, brings it to 1% and another player performs killing blow (using mob.Fighting)
    threat/aggro (see Generating Threat)
    https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/threat-overview-classic-wow

multitable generator, paging a table should repeat the header at the beginning of each page

try to use mapperly to serialize/deserialize to/from XXXData -> MapXXX could be removed from IXXX

ability with different kind of resource, can be paid with mana or rage for example
would be used for https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/spell=33876/mangle which is available for bear (rage) and cat (energy)

handle shapeshift using new type of affect
cat form/bear form with new affects

try to replace is INonPlayableCharacter with overrides (same goes for is IPlayableCharacter)

generic dot affect

try to change every checks on CharacterFlags, ... should be handled with Affect
Aura list on entity should store a lookup<AffectType, IAffect> for rapid access
restore should only remove 'negative' auras

add colors everywhere :)

finish score

critical hit

item owner -> to be used in CanLoot

Poison/Plague/... should not specify character for damage source
    new Damage function without a source with additional message when dying (see update_affect.C:103)

passives/weapons could be shared instead of transient

RomImporter should be related to Mud.Server.Rom24
RotImporter should be related to Mud.Server.Rot
MysteryImporter should be related to Mud.Server.Mystery

should see glowing item if in a dark room
glowing item on the floor of dark room should increase light

affect giving % damage increase/decrease (to be handled in DamageModifierManager)
-> % can lead to unpredictable result
-> imagine 2 affects on same attribute, one with operator + fixed amount and another with operator % amount
    10 + 5 + 20% <> 10 + 20% + 5
    ==> 15 + 15*20/100 = 15 + 3 = 18
    ==> 10 + 10*20/100 + 5 = 10 + 2 + 5 = 17

reimplement hot/dot

when a player connects, if no avatar found -> switch to avatar create state machine
compatibility must only be in blueprint loading
check CanSee usage, if lambda can be removed
choose between flags as bits or strings (example RoomFlags and CharacterFlags)
check usage of OnCleaned/OnRemoved
stop cloning list and stop removing while iterating -> flag the entity as soft deleted and remove them in Cleanup phase

missing help: use dumpcommands

UNIT TESTS
use xunit + moq

Item.GetAura should be based on flags and not ability (check Curse spell)
in general way, Aura should be based on flags instead of abilities (with an optional ability)

unit test for each command!!!
make IGameAction generic on TActor: IActor, same goes for IActionInput

make a map of calls done when a NPC is Removed/StopFollowing/...

module/plugin to enable load on demand of skills/spells/commands/...
commands dynamically added to Character depending on room they are, for example
	we could add list/buy/sell/value to commands if a shopkeeper is in the room
	brandish only when holding a staff
-> hard to do because game actions are generated once

jukebox
offensive flags: rescue, ...
clan/guild, auction house, note
commands: auction, channels, clantalk, report, read, whois, bet, brief, combine, compact, description, noloot, nosummon, prompt, title, config, deaf, pmote, note, board, quote, nwrite,
	myclan, petition, clanlist
admin commands: sockets, exlist, vlist, rename, omatch, mmatch, spy, violate, allow, ban, deny, disconnect, flag, freeze, permban, protect, set, xset, wizlock, newlock, nochannels, noemote, noshout, notell, pecho, 
	teleport, mwhere, owhere, recho, mset, oset, rset, sset, xstat, string, vnum, zecho, clone, smote, prefix, olevel, mlevel, slookup, clans, guild, confiscate/grab, 
PK+THIEF
furniture max weight (doesn't exist in Rom)
linkdead
Move CanSee in IEntity
each time operator IS or AS is used, this should be replaced with an overridable method
pull/push
Multiple wear location
item: protect, room_key
Monitor Recompute calls: recompute may leads to recursive call -> redo logic Unequip/Equip/ChangeContainer
Create item from blueprint with specific level and attributes (used for SpellFloatingDisc and other skill/spell creating item)
UnitTests on Rom24Effects
assist_guard
isValid on aura/periodic aura -> don't remove immediately aura/periodic aura + filter on isValid + remove them during Cleanup phease (--> no more clone of auras needed while modifying/clearing auras, same goes with periodic aura)
leaving impersonation should not stop fighting -> PlayableCharacter can still died while not impersonated
  when impersonating, first search for impersonation in world -> use Guid !! should work if player disconnect/reconnect and reimpersonate
make text drunk in say/whisper/... see act_comm.C:2222
when using FindHelper.FindByName on ICharacter and parameter is self -> return itself

store an Aura list in World this will avoid looping on all room/character/item to check aura
redo DoScore, DoAffects
check if IStat, MStat and RStat display new informations
cannot quit while affected by an harmful aura/periodic aura
while leaving(or reconnecting) aura should be removed ? maybe an additional flag saying if timer should decrease while disconnected ?
remove Send(..., bool addTrailingNewLine)
auto paging if data to send to too big?
check if RelativeDisplayName should be used instead of DisplayName in Command (check if CanSee should be used)
better command parser: should be able to specify something like (should be possible with SyntaxAttribute)
    [command] [room.character] -> first parameter will be parsed as a character found in room
    [command] [world.character] -> first parameter will be parsed as a character found in world
    [command] [room.item|room.character|inventory.item|equipment.item] -> first will be parsed as an item in room, a character in room, an item in inventory, an item in equipment
search commands/skills/spells for additional guards
    what at least one parameter (item) is required
    whom at least one parameter (character) is required
prompt modifiable by user
merge IAdminRepository and IPlayerRepository -> IAccountRepository

casting time ? (-> spell interrupt is needed) --> delayed actions  [[http://www.mudmagic.com/codes/download/diku/merc/rom/snippets/skills_spells/tcasting.txt]]

Loot table: http://www.gammon.com.au/forum/bbshowpost.php?bbsubject_id=9715
Its a bit more complex, but here is how one MMORPG that I am rather familiar with did it:
 You have two types of data:
 1. Treasure Tables
 2. Monster Treasure Lists
 A Treasure Table is a pre-defined set that contains a list of items, each with a given weight and maximum drop quantity. Weights are relative to the total weight of all items in the table. 
 TreasureTable_Spider
 - Spider Venom, weight=25, max=1
 - Spider Webbing, weight=65, max=1
 - Severed Spider Leg, weight=10, max=1
 This would give the Spider Venom a 25% chance of dropping if this table were called (25 / 100).
 Now, you also have Monster Treasure Lists. These are defined on the monster itself and refer to Treasure Tables using relative weights and max quantities. The monster also has a min/max of items it can drop (# of pulls from the tables).
 Spider
 - Min=1, Max=1
 - TreasureTable_Spider, weight=45, max=1
 - TreasureTable_RareLoot, weight=5, max=1
 - EmptyTreasureTable, weight=50, max=1
 So basically 50% of the time you would get no loot, 45% of the time you'd get something from TreasureTable_Spider and 5% of the time from TreasureTable_RareLoot.
 What this does is allows you to manage what mobs drop without having to alter each and every mob. You want to add another item to the rare loot table, next load it will be there and available to players.
 The downside to this system is it can be complex and it is harder to get an idea of the overall drop-rate of individual items. For example, if you were looking for Spider Webbing using the data above your effective % chance would be 29.25% (45% to call the Spider table, 65% to get Webbing inside that table).
