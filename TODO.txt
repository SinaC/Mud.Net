NEXT:

unit test for each command!!!
make IGameAction generic on TActor: IActor, same goes for IActionInput

make a map of calls done when a NPC is Removed/StopFollowing/...

commands dynamically added to Character depending on room they are, for example
	we could add list/buy/sell/value to commands if a shopkeeper is in the room
	brandish only when holding a staff

redo Mud.Server.Tests.Abilities.AcidBlastTests, CastTests


module/plugin to enable load on demand of skills/spells/commands/...

remove position incap, mortal, stunned -> probably remove UpdatePosition, replaced stunned with a 'timer'
offensive flags: rescue, bite, crush, ...
clan/guild, auction house, help, socials, wimpy, note
commands: auction, channels, clantalk, compare, report, read, socials, whois, bet, brief, combine, compact, description, noloot, nosummon, outfit, prompt, title, wimpy, config, deaf, pmote, note, board, quote, nwrite,
	heal, autoaffect, wake, myclan, petition, clanlist
admin commands: sockets, exlist, vlist, rename, omatch, mmatch, spy, violate, allow, ban, deny, disconnect, flag, freeze, permban, protect, set, xset, wizlock, newlock, nochannels, noemote, noshout, notell, pecho, 
	teleport, mwhere, owhere, recho, mset, oset, rset, sset, xstat, string, vnum, zecho, clone, smote, prefix, olevel, mlevel, slookup, clans, guild, confiscate/grab, 
PK
Add ctor to every manager with other manager as parameter to easy unit tests
prevent kill stealing: a player fights a mob, brings it to 1% and another player performs killing blow (using mob.Fighting)
linkdead
Move CanSee in IEntity
each time operator IS or AS is used, this should be replaced with an overridable method
pull/push
Multiple wear location
Reset 'R'
quest: add quest item on the fly when player takes the quest
item: protect, room_key
Monitor Recompute calls
Recompute may leads to recursive call -> redo logic Unequip/Equip/ChangeContainer
Create item from blueprint with specific level and attributes (used for SpellFloatingDisc and other skill/spell creating item)
skills: steal/lore
spells: create rose, farsight, identify
assign abilities to classes
Unit tests on spell/skill to check if method argument matches AbilityTarget, check if ItemInventoryOrCharacterDefensive have both dispel message
UnitTests CastFromItem/GetItemAbilityTarget
UnitTests on Rom24Effects
Shop: appraise
specials
assist_guard
aggro table
isValid on aura/periodic aura -> don't remove immediately aura/periodic aura + filter on isValid + remove them during Cleanup phease (--> no more clone of auras needed while modifying/clearing auras, same goes with periodic aura)
automated quests
quest history
leaving impersonation should not stop fighting -> PlayableCharacter can still died while not impersonated
  when impersonating, first search for impersonation in world -> use Guid !! should work if player disconnect/reconnect and reimpersonate
make text drunk in say/whisper/... see act_comm.C:2222
when using FindHelper.FindByName on ICharacter and parameter is self -> return itself
alignment at creation ?
Idea: move HP and move in ResourceKinds
Use SafeList where List is used
Add daze to IPlayableCharacter: will be decreased like GCD and affects skill effectiveness
store an Aura list in World this will avoid looping on all room/character/item to check aura
Save blueprint in Hashtable
Enum string representation instead of int in Repository
redo DoScore, DoAffects
check if IStat, MStat and RStat display new informations
When an item quest objective is complete, quest item should be NoTake or should be invisible
cannot quit while affected by an harmful aura/periodic aura
while leaving(or reconnecting) aura should be removed ? maybe an additional flag saying if timer should decrease while disconnected ?
remove Send(..., bool addTrailingNewLine)
auto paging if data to send to too big?
check if RelativeDisplayName should be used instead of DisplayName in Command (check if CanSee should be used)
quest save completed quests
      quest tree (prereq)
      repeteable or not quests
      autogenerate
better command parser: should be able to specify something like     will be possible with SyntaxAttribute
    [command] [room.character] -> first parameter will be parsed as a character found in room
    [command] [world.character] -> first parameter will be parsed as a character found in world
    [command] [room.item|room.character|inventory.item|equipment.item] -> first will be parsed as an item in room, a character in room, an item in inventory, an item in equipment
wear item
     all
     all.item
look no arg
     in|on|into container
     character
     item
     extradescription
     direction
multitable generator, paging a table should repeat the header at the beginning of each page
prompt modifiable by user
merge IAdminRepository and IPlayerRepository -> IAccountRepository
move blueprints to Mud.Domain + refactor Mud.Domain
IWorld: should create IReadonlyWorld which only contains getter

casting time ? (-> spell interrupt is needed) --> delayed actions  [[http://www.mudmagic.com/codes/download/diku/merc/rom/snippets/skills_spells/tcasting.txt]]

    at(quite difficult to implement)
    most [MustBeImpersonated] command should work when incarnating
